      <description>Dynamics # Distortion # How Distortion Works in Music (Ben Sheron&amp;rsquo;s Blog)
Clipping (Soft &amp;amp; Hard) # Clipping does exactly what it sounds like, it just chops off the wave. While you can use it as an effect intentionally, it&amp;rsquo;s origin - which you&amp;rsquo;re likely to do on accident yourself - is from accidently driving a louder signal into something than it&amp;rsquo;s meant to handle. When this happens, the portion of the incoming wave that is out of range is going to get chopped off no matter what, but there are mulitple ways than can happen: it can be hard or soft.</description>

      <description>Filters (LP, HP, BP, Notch) # https://www.perfectcircuit.com/signal/learning-synthesis-filters
Low Pass Filters # Low Pass filters do what you think, they let the low frequencies pass and cut out the high frequencies. As with most filters, this will typically not be a sharp cutoff but instead be a gradual fading of the higher frequencies. Despite this, there is still a point called the cut off frequency, which is defined as the point where the signal is cut by 3db (what this means is discussed below).</description>

Gain-Staging # Gain staging is the practice of setting the gain or level of each stage in a signal chain, such as in a mixer or a sound system, to an optimal level. This is important because it ensures that the signal remains at a consistent level as it passes through each stage of the signal chain, which can help to avoid distortion and other problems.</description>

      <description>Misc Effects # Auto-Tune # Given it&amp;rsquo;s basically a meme now, I assume you know what Auto-Tune is. What you may not realize is that not all auto-tune is, well, auto. A lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s done manually, painstakingly correcting the tuning. If the original sound is close enough, it&amp;rsquo;s usually pretty easy to get it to sound natural, too.
Also keep in mind pitch correction isn&amp;rsquo;t just for vocals, you might want to pitch correct your guitar playing, change a note in an already recorded sequence when you change keys, or even just use it as a glitchy effect on pitch bends.</description>

      <description>Time Based Effects # Delay # Delay is basically echo. Take a sound in, and repeat it it it. Normally the main controls on a delay are &amp;lsquo;Time&amp;rsquo;, which controls how long of a delay there is before each repeat, &amp;lsquo;Feedback&amp;rsquo; which controls how much the level is reduced each time the delay repeats (and in turn, how many audible repetitions there are), and &amp;lsquo;Dry/Wet&amp;rsquo; which controls how the signal is blended, entirely dry will have no delay, entirely wet may even miss the initial sound adding a weird latency before you hear what you&amp;rsquo;re playing.</description>

      <description>Trivial Effects # Tremolo # This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically. This can be done at different speeds (really fast for a &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; effect or slow for something pad-like) and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect.</description>

Logical Mixing parts together Studying music theory Getting core components of the song laid out Practicing tecnique on an instrument Writing lyrics with good timings and structure Creative Using weird sound sources Combining effects Finding inspiration outside of music Adding fun frills to the song Writing vivid, emotional lyrics If you know that you&amp;rsquo;re a creative type, try to focus on the science and math and technique of things more on these pages and as you practice.</description>

      <description>Continuing our Adventure # Picking up where we left off,
This lil&amp;rsquo; synth works, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us much control, and unlike a real instrument, after we let go of the key it just immediately stops. Similarly, most real instruments have a either a bit of a pluck at the start or a more gentle fade in.
This leads us to the idea of envelopes. In music, you&amp;rsquo;ll often want to draw a shape that evelopes a signal.</description>

      <description>Percussion # Theory # Before I even dive into Percussion, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to point out how generic the term is. Just looking at the Wikipedia page for drum kit, you&amp;rsquo;ll see this:
Drum Kit page on Wikipedia and clearly that&amp;rsquo;s still not an exhaustive list. Just off the top of my head I can see it lacks the Cajon or Taiko as acoustic instruments, let alone anything more specific than electronic drum, which can make for a class all its own.</description>

      <description>Strings # Picture of my character by Alex the Nerd Bird Guitars # Acoustic, Electric, Acoustic-Electric? # Hollow Body, Solid Body? # Pickups? # Strings? # [TODO]
Nylon vs plain vs wound, metal types, coated. Gauges. https://blog.ernieball.com/strings/what-string-gauges-should-you-be-playing/ . This page does reference neck length, so keep that in mind too!
My recommendation, first and foremost, is try them. Strings are cheap, swap &amp;rsquo;em out, try each for a month, note your experiences before and after- how they felt, sounded, if they left your fingers sore, if pitch bending was fun, etc.</description>

      <description>Synthesizers # [TODO] I&amp;rsquo;ve already talked about FM, additive, subtractive, etc. in Sound Sources. Here I want to go into how they fit into a song, the idea of pads, leads, bass. As well as how a lot of famous sounds have been done and what some of the most famous synths are. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to cover some of why some newer synths are exciting, like the Hydrasynth, Continumm, Norand Mono, Subharmonicon, Polygogo,</description>

      <description>Wind # What is a Wind Instrument? # A wind instrument is a musical instrument that contains some type of resonator (usually a tube) in which a column of air is set into vibration by the player blowing into (or over) a mouthpiece set at or near the end of the resonator. The pitch of the vibration is determined by the length of the tube and by manual modifications of the effective length of the vibrating column of air.</description>

      <description>Bang!. Zwoop. Bada-dap-bap. # Here&amp;rsquo;s a sine wave.
I want you to try something. Put your foot back up on your heel and each time you see a new peak, tap the ground. Play a non existent kick drum to each new peak. (or just tap a finger on your desk)
To some people, keeping this beat is difficult. To some it will come naturally. Either is fine. This could be the tempo of a song, the metronome that everything is playing in time to, and it&amp;rsquo;s just a wave.</description>

      <description>MIDI in Detail # Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI is what it sounds like, the primary way to get data between devices digitally. Want to tell a hardware synth to play a sequence you arranged on your computer? MIDI. Want to play notes into your computer using a keyboard? MIDI. Want to sequence drums, with varying &amp;lsquo;velocity&amp;rsquo; on each hit? MIDI.
Sounds Great?
For the most part, yeah. Everything works together and you can make all your hardware speak the same language.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not going to outright condone you to find pirated versions of music software, though- in part for liability, but mostly because you absolutely will get a virus. That said, some sites are more reputable than others, and if you&amp;rsquo;re careful, you can probably yoink at least a few things. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you should.</description>

      <description>Psychoacoustics and Cultural Associations # When we hear music, we don&amp;rsquo;t hear individual sine waves and sum them up. We don&amp;rsquo;t hear instruments devoid of context, either- a ukulele carries a different cultural meaning than a mandolin. We also don&amp;rsquo;t just hear what comes out the speakers as plainly as basic frequencies. Our ears process what we here. Our ears take in the reverb of the room, ignore sounds before and after drum hits, find speech in sounds that weren&amp;rsquo;t meant to.</description>

      <description>Digital Audio Workstations+ # A Digital Audio Workstations is software that allows you to record and edit audio, host and play digital instruments, arrange the parts in a timeline, and mix the audio together. The most common DAWs you&amp;rsquo;ll see are Ableton Live (Often called just &amp;ldquo;Ableton&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Live&amp;rdquo;) and FL Studio, but there are plenty of other options as well, many of which are listed below.
The definition of a DAW is a bit fuzzy, as tools like VCV Rack and Audacity- both of which we&amp;rsquo;ve seen previously- have features that make them very DAW like and can be used to make full tracks (assuming you have hardware instruments to record into Audacity)</description>

      <description>VCV Rack Tips &amp;amp; Tricks # I am not affiliated with VCV or the Rack software in any way. Despite the mess in the VCV community, I&amp;rsquo;ve still put in a lot of time in the software and run a pretty large group chat on Telegram where it (alongside hardware Eurorack) is the main focus. In that chat, there&amp;rsquo;s been a few recurring questions, this page is just some of those questions and answers.</description>

See Optimizing The Latency Of Your PC Audio Interface from Sound on Sound for more info about this, but generally just set your buffer size as low as you can until it starts to sound like it&amp;rsquo;s horribly broken.</description>

      <description>Music Hardware # While you could make all of your music with just a computer, you‚Äôll probably want some tools that make your life as a musician easier and let you explore ideas faster. Like I said back in the Audio Effects Chapter , in my experience, making music depends on a really quick brain to input device feedback loop. Being able to turn a physical knob and mash physical keys will often lead to better results if only because you‚Äôre able to try things both faster and by physically interacting with something that you may not have thought of otherwise.</description>
