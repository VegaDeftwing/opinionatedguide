      <description>MIDI in Detail #  Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI is what it sounds like, the primary way to get data between devices digitally. Want to tell a hardware synth to play a sequence you arranged on your computer? MIDI. Want to play notes into your computer using a keyboard? MIDI. Want to sequence drums, with varying &amp;lsquo;velocity&amp;rsquo; on each hit? MIDI.
Sounds Great?
For the most part, yeah. Everything works together and you can make all your hardware speak the same language.</description>

      <description>Audio Effects #  A lot of audio effects boil down to automating some simple parameter. Some times you may not actually need a dedicated effect and can instead get by with using Automation Lanes (YouTube, once upon a synth) in you Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) Also don&amp;rsquo;t get to deep into gear envy. Effects are awesome and it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to either want to collect them and hoard them like a happy dragon on a pile of gold or feel like you can&amp;rsquo;t make music without that one perfect effect.</description>

      <description>Instruments #  What is an Instrument? #  Okay, yeah, that sounds like a stupid question, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to think about. Wikipedia has it defined like this:
 A musical instrument is a device created or adapted to make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can be considered a musical instrument—it is through purpose that the object becomes a musical instrument. - Wikipedia   which, okay, that&amp;rsquo;s fair enough.</description>

      <description>Getting Started #  Here&amp;rsquo;s the part where I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to explain how to read music or something boring like that. Really though, that&amp;rsquo;s not why you&amp;rsquo;re here. So let me start by giving you a bit of motivation. In a bit I&amp;rsquo;ll be going though how to use VCV Rack, a free (with paid addons, but those aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary) program for making music. But as we go though each bit is going to look so -basic- that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>Music Hardware #  While you could make all of your music with just computer, you’ll probably want some tools that make your life as a musician easier and let you explore ideas faster. Like I said back in the Audio Effects Chapter, in my experience, making music depends on a really quick brain to input device feedback loop. Being able to turn a physical knob and mash physical keys will often lead to better results if only because you’re able to try things both faster and by physically interacting with something that you may not have thought of otherwise.</description>

      <description>Music Software #  Some tools on this page are not-free. As such, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to list prices as best I can. Music software usually goes on sale pretty significantly around Black Friday or Christmas, so when I can, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to list &amp;lsquo;street&amp;rsquo; prices. Regardless, I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with any of these projects in any way and I don&amp;rsquo;t make any money from these links- so don&amp;rsquo;t complain to me if the prices are wrong ╮(─▽─)╭ Digital Audio Workstations+ #  A Digital Audio Workstations is software that allows you to record and edit audio, host and play digital instruments, arrange the parts in a time line, and mix the audio together.</description>

      <description>Sequencing &amp;amp; Midi #  This chapter only goes over the basics of MIDI. Because MIDI is so important to music production I&amp;rsquo;ll dive much deeper into the details of MIDI in Chapter 6½ - MIDI in Detail Sequencing #  The definition of a sequence is pretty obvious, but don&amp;rsquo;t be misled by the name- a &amp;ldquo;sequence&amp;rdquo; is not always just a list of notes to be played one after the other.</description>

      <description>Methods of making noise #  Samples #   a snippet of a .wav file open in audacity
 A sample is exactly as the name implies- a &amp;lsquo;sample&amp;rsquo; of audio. Sample is a pretty broad term though, so usually some more terms are applied to help categorize them. The easiest to explain is what is usually meant by sample: a small audio file that contains one sound, like one drum hit or one piano key press.</description>

      <description>First, this: #   Theory #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest. I can&amp;rsquo;t read music and I don&amp;rsquo;t know scales. Why, then, would I in any way think I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to write anything about music? Well, let me stop you right there, I&amp;rsquo;m not. I make music for fun. However, I like to think that people enjoy my music and I enjoy listening to it myself as I make it, and though my experience I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a little here and there to make sure things don&amp;rsquo;t sound awful.</description>

      <description>Video &amp;amp; Streaming #  [TODO, basically the entire page]
Cameras #  If you&amp;rsquo;re like most people, the best camera you own is probably you&amp;rsquo;re phone camera.
Lighting #  I found hanging up some of those string light LED edison bulbs (like you&amp;rsquo;d see at a wedding) on the ceiling works well as an alternative to a softbox. It&amp;rsquo;s so many point lights that it adds up to a similar effect- albeit with the downside that you can&amp;rsquo;t move them around.</description>
