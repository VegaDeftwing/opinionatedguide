      <description>Dynamics #   document.getElementById(&#34;effectMenu&#34;).open = true;  Distortion #   How Distortion Works in Music (Ben Sheron&amp;rsquo;s Blog)
Clipping (Soft &amp;amp; Hard) #  Clipping does exactly what it sounds like, it just chops off the wave. Usually on both the top and bottom.
Hard Clipping
 Soft Clipping
  The key take away from the two different kinds of clipping is that while both add harmonics, hard clipping adds significantly more.</description>

Low Pass Filters #  Low Pass filters do what you think, they let the low frequencies pass and cut out the high frequencies. As with most filters, this will typically not be a sharp cutoff but instead be a gradual fading of the higher frequencies. Despite this, there is still a point called the cut off frequency, which is defined as the point where the signal is cut by 3db (what this means is discussed below).</description>

      <description>Misc Effects #   document.getElementById(&#34;effectMenu&#34;).open = true;  Auto-Tune #  Given it&amp;rsquo;s basically a meme now, I assume you know what Auto-Tune is. What you may not realize is that not all auto-tune is, well, auto. A lot of the time it&amp;rsquo;s done manually, painstakingly correcting the tuning. If the original sound is close enough, it&amp;rsquo;s usually pretty easy to get it to sound natural too.
Also keep in mind pitch correction isn&amp;rsquo;t just for vocals, you might want to pitch correct your guitar playing, change a note in an already recorded sequence when you change keys, or even just use it as a glitchy effect on pitch bends.</description>

      <description>Time Based Effects #   document.getElementById(&#34;effectMenu&#34;).open = true;  Delay #  Delay is basically echo. Take a sound in, and repeat it it it. Normally the main controls on a delay are &amp;lsquo;Time&amp;rsquo;, which controls how long of a delay there is before each repeat, &amp;lsquo;Feedback&amp;rsquo; which controls how much the level is reduced each time the delay repeats (and in turn, how many audible repetitions there are), and &amp;lsquo;Dry/Wet&amp;rsquo; which controls how the signal is blended, entirely dry will have no delay, entirely wet may even miss the initial sound adding a weird latency before you hear what you&amp;rsquo;re playing.</description>

      <description>Trivial Effects #   document.getElementById(&#34;effectMenu&#34;).open = true;  Tremolo #  This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically. This can be done at different speeds (really fast for a &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; effect or slow for something pad-like) and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect.</description>

      <description>Percussion #   document.getElementById(&#34;instMenu&#34;).open = true;  Theory #  Before I even dive into Percussion, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to point out how generic the term is. Just looking at the Wikipedia page for drum kit you&amp;rsquo;ll see this:
Drum Kit page on Wikipedia and clearly that&amp;rsquo;s still not an exhaustive list. Just off the top of my head I can see it lacks the Cajon or Taiko as acoustic instruments, let alone anything more specific than electronic drum, which can make for a class all its own.</description>

Here I want to go into how they fit into a song, the idea of pads, leads, bass. As well as how a lot of famous sounds have been done and what some of the most famous synths are. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to cover some of why some newer synths are exciting, like the Hydrasynth, Continumm, Norand Mono, Subharmonicon, Polygogo,</description>

      <description>Wind #   document.getElementById(&#34;instMenu&#34;).open = true;  What is a Wind Instrument? #   A wind instrument is a musical instrument that contains some type of resonator (usually a tube) in which a column of air is set into vibration by the player blowing into (or over) a mouthpiece set at or near the end of the resonator. The pitch of the vibration is determined by the length of the tube and by manual modifications of the effective length of the vibrating column of air.</description>

      <description>MIDI in Detail #  Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI is what it sounds like, the primary way to get data between devices digitally. Want to tell a hardware synth to play a sequence you arranged on your computer? MIDI. Want to play notes into your computer using a keyboard? MIDI. Want to sequence drums, with varying &amp;lsquo;velocity&amp;rsquo; on each hit? MIDI.
Sounds Great?
For the most part, yeah. Everything works together and you can make all your hardware speak the same language.</description>

      <description>Piracy? #  Plugins++ #  Look, I&amp;rsquo;m not the police. I don&amp;rsquo;t really care what you do on your system. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to outright condone you find pirated versions of music software though- in part for liability, but mostly because you absolutely will get a virus. That said, some sites are more reputable than others, and if you&amp;rsquo;re careful, you can probably yoink at least a few things. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you should.</description>

      <description>Psychoacoustics and Cultural Associations #   When we here music, we don&amp;rsquo;t hear individual sine waves and sum them up. We don&amp;rsquo;t hear instruments devoid of context either- a ukulele carries a different cultral meaning than a mandolin. We also don&amp;rsquo;t just hear what comes out the speakers as planly as basic frequencies. Our ears process what we here. Our ears take in the reverb of the room, ignore sounds before and after drum hits, find speech in sounds that weren&amp;rsquo;t meant to.</description>

In that chat, there&amp;rsquo;s been a feel recurring questions, this page is just some of those questions and answers.</description>

See Optimizing The Latency Of Your PC Audio Interface from Sound on Sound for more info about this, but generally just set your buffer size as low as you can until it starts to sound like it&amp;rsquo;s horribly broken.</description>

Really though, that&amp;rsquo;s not why you&amp;rsquo;re here. So let me start by giving you a bit of motivation. In a bit I&amp;rsquo;ll be going though how to use VCV Rack, a free (with paid addons, but those aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary) program for making music. But as we go though each bit is going to look so -basic- that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>Music Hardware #  While you could make all of your music with just computer, you‚Äôll probably want some tools that make your life as a musician easier and let you explore ideas faster. Like I said back in the Audio Effects Chapter  , in my experience, making music depends on a really quick brain to input device feedback loop. Being able to turn a physical knob and mash physical keys will often lead to better results if only because you‚Äôre able to try things both faster and by physically interacting with something that you may not have thought of otherwise.</description>

Sample is a pretty broad term though, so usually some more terms are applied to help categorize them. The easiest to explain is what is usually meant by sample: a small audio file that contains one sound, like one drum hit or one piano key press.</description>

Theory #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest. I can&amp;rsquo;t read music and I don&amp;rsquo;t know scales. Why, then, would I in any way think I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to write anything about music?</description>

You absolutely should not expect your YouTube or Twitch channel to make it big. Even if you put in the work, invest in good eqipment, and make cool content regularly, and promote the shit out of yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s still a game of luck on if you can go viral and if you can retain any viewership whatsoever after doing so.</description>
