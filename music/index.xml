      <description>Dynamics # Distortion # How Distortion Works in Music (Ben Sheron&amp;rsquo;s Blog)
Dynamics &amp;amp; Transients # When thinking of effects we have some nice mental models for what things sound like. Delay is just echos, reverb adds space, etc. Distortions sound simple enough, they just make it more aggressive - the problem is, they sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t. We have to think like an audio engineer here.
First, they sound massively different depending on the volume and frequency content of the input.</description>

      <description>Filters (LP, HP, BP, Notch) # See the signal processing chapters. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do real time DSP and if you want to modulate the cutoff, you&amp;rsquo;re probably stuck with an IIR. FWIW, the delay of an FIR means the linear phase is often worse than not anyway. If licensing isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to start with at least https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/Filters/index.html or really any DSP library. Implementing a well performing filter isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard.</description>

Gain-Staging # Gain staging is the practice of setting the gain or level of each stage in a signal chain, such as in a mixer or a sound system, to an optimal level.</description>

      <description>Misc Effects # Auto-Tune # Doing autotune in code is well beyond the scope of a small comment. Outside of just throwing AI at the problem - witch is likely to sound god awful - there&amp;rsquo;s no magic bullet here. It&amp;rsquo;s spectral analysis hell. Given it&amp;rsquo;s basically a meme now, I assume you know what Auto-Tune is. What you may not realize is that not all auto-tune is, well, auto.</description>

      <description>Time Based Effects # Delay # There are a million ways to make a delay that&amp;rsquo;s weird. Most basic? Make a ring buffer and add the signals, probably with a dry/wet mix. Less basic? IDK, add in multiple taps on the ring buffer? Use random samples in the buffer? Change the sample rate of the buffer? Reverse the buffer occasionally? Go nuts. Delay is basically echo. Take a sound in, and repeat it it it.</description>

      <description>Trivial Effects # Tremolo # This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically. This can be done at different speeds (really fast for a &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; effect or slow for something pad-like) and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect.</description>

      <description>Continuing our Adventure # Picking up where we left off,
This lil&amp;rsquo; synth works, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us much control, and unlike a real instrument, after we let go of the key it just immediately stops. Similarly, most real instruments have a either a bit of a pluck at the start or a more gentle fade in.
This leads us to the idea of envelopes. In music, you&amp;rsquo;ll often want to draw a shape that evelopes a signal.</description>

      <description>Electro-Mechanical Instruments # I have a particular love of instruments that sit in that acoustic sweet spot where i feels as though there&amp;rsquo;s a physical resonating body merged with a synthesizer, where you can hear key clicks and a physical body but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t respond like we&amp;rsquo;re used to yet it&amp;rsquo;s not so avant-garde as not not be useful or just a gimmick.
Think a hurdy gurdy, but with an inbuilt tube amp and the drones are actually tube based oscillators.</description>

      <description>Percussion # Theory # Before I even dive into Percussion, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to point out how generic the term is. Just looking at the Wikipedia page for drum kit, you&amp;rsquo;ll see this: Drum Kit page on Wikipedia and clearly that&amp;rsquo;s still not an exhaustive list. Just off the top of my head I can see it lacks the Cajon or Taiko as acoustic instruments, let alone anything more specific than electronic drum, which can make for a class all its own.</description>

      <description>Strings # Guitars # Picture of my character by Alex the Nerd Bird Acoustic, Electric, Acoustic-Electric? # Hollow Body, Solid Body? # Pickups? # Frets? # Some guitars used &amp;ldquo;fanned&amp;rdquo; or multi-scale frets. This is most common on extended range (7+ string) guitars. The intent is that the scale length can be longer for the thick string and shorter for the thin so that the tension on all of them is reasonable (it avoids the low string being floppy).</description>

As well as how a lot of famous sounds have been done and what some of the most famous synths are. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to cover some of why some newer synths are exciting, like the Hydrasynth, Continumm, Norand Mono, Subharmonicon, Polygogo,</description>

      <description>Wind # What is a Wind Instrument? # A wind instrument is a musical instrument that contains some type of resonator (usually a tube) in which a column of air is set into vibration by the player blowing into (or over) a mouthpiece set at or near the end of the resonator. The pitch of the vibration is determined by the length of the tube and by manual modifications of the effective length of the vibrating column of air.</description>

      <description>Bang!. Zwoop. Bada-dap-bap. # Here&amp;rsquo;s a sine wave.
I want you to try something. Put your foot back up on your heel and each time you see a new peak, tap the ground. Play a non existent kick drum to each new peak. (or just tap a finger on your desk)
To some people, keeping this beat is difficult. To some it will come naturally. Either is fine. This could be the tempo of a song, the metronome that everything is playing in time to, and it&amp;rsquo;s just a wave.</description>

      <description>I lied # Well, sort of. I haven&amp;rsquo;t told you anything that&amp;rsquo;s wrong, but I have been omitting something.
The software we&amp;rsquo;re using, VCV Rack, is very weird. It lacks many features that most people expect in a DAW - Digital Audio Workstation. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk significantly more about DAWs in a coming page, but I need to bring them up now because there&amp;rsquo;s some things that VCV absolutely does not do well that will make creating full songs that sound like music you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to unnecessarily difficult.</description>

      <description>MIDI in Detail # Musical Instrument Digital Interface, or MIDI is what it sounds like, the primary way to get data between devices digitally. Want to tell a hardware synth to play a sequence you arranged on your computer? MIDI. Want to play notes into your computer using a keyboard? MIDI. Want to sequence drums, with varying &amp;lsquo;velocity&amp;rsquo; on each hit? MIDI.
Sounds Great?
For the most part, yeah. Everything works together and you can make all your hardware speak the same language.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not going to outright condone you to find pirated versions of music software, though- in part for liability, but mostly because you absolutely will get a virus. Some sites are more reputable than others, and if you&amp;rsquo;re careful, you can probably yoink at least a few things. Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not saying you should.</description>

      <description>Psychoacoustics and Cultural Associations # When we hear music, we don&amp;rsquo;t hear individual sine waves and sum them up. We don&amp;rsquo;t hear instruments devoid of context, either- a ukulele carries a different cultural meaning than a mandolin. We also don&amp;rsquo;t just hear what comes out the speakers as plainly as basic frequencies. Our ears process what we here. Our ears take in the reverb of the room, ignore sounds before and after drum hits, find speech in sounds that weren&amp;rsquo;t meant to.</description>

      <description>Sequencing &amp;amp; Midi # MIDI In Detail covers the technical bits of MIDI in much more detail, but you&#39;ll still probably want to read this first if you don&#39;t know what MIDI even is. Sequencing # The definition of a sequence is pretty obvious, but don&amp;rsquo;t be misled by the name- a &amp;ldquo;sequence&amp;rdquo; is not always just a list of notes to be played one after the other. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s overlap, gaps (rests), bends from one note to another (legato) and almost always information about how hard a note is pressed and how long it should be held for are saved.</description>

      <description>Digital Audio Workstations+ # A Digital Audio Workstations is software that allows you to record and edit audio, host and play digital instruments, arrange the parts in a timeline, and mix the audio together. The most common DAWs you&amp;rsquo;ll see are Ableton Live (Often called just &amp;ldquo;Ableton&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Live&amp;rdquo;) and FL Studio, but there are plenty of other options as well, many of which are listed below.
The definition of a DAW is a bit fuzzy, as tools like VCV Rack and Audacity- both of which we&amp;rsquo;ve seen previously- have features that make them very DAW like and can be used to make full tracks (assuming you have hardware instruments to record into Audacity)</description>

      <description>Music Hardware # While you could make all of your music with just a computer, you‚Äôll probably want some tools that make your life as a musician easier and let you explore ideas faster. Like I said back in the Audio Effects Chapter , in my experience, making music depends on a really quick brain to input device feedback loop. Being able to turn a physical knob and mash physical keys will often lead to better results if only because you‚Äôre able to try things both faster and by physically interacting with something that you may not have thought of otherwise.</description>

You absolutely should not expect your YouTube or Twitch channel to make it big. Even if you put in the work, invest in good equipment, and make cool content regularly, and promote the shit out of yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s still a game of luck on if you can go viral and if you can retain any viewership whatsoever after doing so.</description>
