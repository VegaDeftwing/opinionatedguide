## Audio Interfaces

[TODO, ADAT, preamps, headphone amps, phantom48]

> Weird side note:
>
> Some VOIP software (Discord, Zoom, etc.) may want you to use a Sample rate of 48Khz and a Buffer size of 192. No clue why.

## Headphones/speakers

[TODO studio headphones V regular]

[TODO openback v Closed]

[TODO Planar magnetic]

## Notes on Hardware **NOT** to buy

* The Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators are cool, fun, etc. But they're pretty fragile and have some issues. Generally, I don't think they're worth it. Here's Some alternatives
  * [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/)
  * [DityWave M8](https://dirtywave.com)
  * or, if you're feeling spendy, the OP-1 and OP-Z are options. Each have their own quirks though, so be sure to do your research. Regardless, I really don't recomend the TE PO's

## Notes on how your hardware will be more expensive than you think

[TODO] Balanced audio, group loop isolation, impedance matching, isolated power supplies, cables ... so many cables
