      <description>3D Modeling, Sculpting, Painting, Shading, and Rendering # Art by TalonCreations This chapter will be using various programs, not all of which are free. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to recommend things that are open source if I can, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep the cost down as much as possible. You definitely can do everything in this chapter for free, just be aware that without some of the paid tools it may be substantially harder.</description>

      <description>Analog Art # What makes it &amp;lsquo;analog&amp;rsquo; # So, for OpGuides I&amp;rsquo;m going to refer to any non-digital art as analog. Traditionally, this art is called, well, traditional. I don&amp;rsquo;t like this term as it implies that there&amp;rsquo;s a right &amp;rsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; way to do things, and that&amp;rsquo;s a load of shit. So, whenever I say analog, don&amp;rsquo;t think about it too much. I just mean not using software and a computer, or, if a computer is used, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for the end product, like 3D printing and the like.</description>

      <description>Analog Art to Digital Art # Scanning in your Analog Art # [TODO] Scanner DPI, etc.
Background Removal # Via vector art tools # Before doing this, you should really know what vector art is and how it differs from the raster art you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about this a bit in the previous chapter, Digital Art . This process requires combining the two, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit odd if you haven&amp;rsquo;t used vector art tools before.</description>

      <description>Digital Art # Photo by cece kun The primary tool of the digital artist‚Ä¶ The pen? # I want to give you a heads-up that making digital art without a pen tablet or pen display of some sort is pretty awful. You can get a cheap pen tablet - they&amp;rsquo;re basically like a mouse pad that you use a pen on - for ~$30. Or you can get a fancy pen display, where you draw directly on the screen, for about ~$300 (similar to the one in the picture above; however, one that large is probably much more expensive)</description>

      <description>Generative Art # This page is almost completely devoid of actual educational content. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make the most complete list of generative art tools and libraries on the internet. Of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t actually make an exhaustive list and may be missing some of the newest tools and ideals, so please check out these other communities for more: r/proceduralgeneration
r/generative
r/PlotterArt
You may notice this page lacks AI generative art tools such as DALL¬∑E 2, Midjourney, &amp;amp; Stable Diffusion.</description>

      <description>Vega&amp;rsquo;s Not-As-Basics of Art and Design # So, we have the basics that any art program will focus on - Lines, Shape, Form, Color, Space, Texture, Value - and these are the standard starting topics for good reason. They&amp;rsquo;re tried and tested to make people better at art, and they apply to any piece. This is great, but I think there are a few things left out of this for the purpose of making it broadly applicable.</description>

      <description>Content is King # At the end of the day, you can make a cool looking fancy website, but you still have to have something to say, a story to tell, a tutorial, videos, something to play. something. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a print book, you can come back and edit it later. The important thing is to just make something.
It really doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be good at first, it just has to exist.</description>

      <description>Cost # So, a pretty big question you should ask right away is &amp;ldquo;How much does this cost?&amp;rdquo;, and you probably already know the answer.
It depends.
First thing you should worry about is the cost of hosting, but, uhh, what is hosting?
Hosting? # So, if you really want to, you can run a web server off of your home internet connection. This has a few problems though:</description>

Platforms like Facebook, Tumblr, etc. - Social Media - don&amp;rsquo;t let you really customize the look of your page
‚Ä¶ and they track you
‚Ä¶ and they make the experience bad for those without accounts
‚Ä¶ and they can limit your speech, ban your account, etc.

      <description>Jack of All Trades # You probably noticed the mildly ugly gradient heading this section, that was my warning to you that you&amp;rsquo;re about to walk into something that requires an interesting mixture of design and engineering skills. Making a good website requires a fair understanding of computers, some basic programming skills, and a willingness to dive into some technical topics. There&amp;rsquo;s a good reason most blogging now happens on Medium or Tumblr and that social media has boomed: The barrier to entry is significantly lower.</description>

      <description>CSS # Let me start by saying that Cascading Style Sheets - CSS - is not a hard language to write. The problem is not the language(1), but with how humans don&amp;rsquo;t think about style and art in a linear way and dealing with the complexities of different devices.
How we think about style # Look around this website, there are things that have been made stylistically cohesive - the color theme, the way I indicate that something is a local link by putting it in a button with a color that matches where it goes.</description>

      <description>Draft: CSS Features That Aren&amp;rsquo;t Widely Supported But Should Be # element() - https://www.stefanjudis.com/a-firefox-only-minimap/
It&amp;rsquo;s highly unlikely chrome will ever support these has() - should be supported soon
@scope - will probably exist eventually, still quite new
text-wrap: balance - seems to be polyfill-able, https://github.com/adobe/balance-text and will likely be supported eventually
This page will also check if the polyfill works. It seems to just fine. I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to condone using it yet though, as the polyfill sholudn&amp;rsquo;t be necessary for long.</description>

      <description>HTML # Alright, so HyperText Markup Language is the one thing on this list I suspect everyone reading this page has at least a smidgen of familiarity with, and it&amp;rsquo;s really very easy to work with, so let&amp;rsquo;s just dive in.
In general, you&amp;rsquo;ll be working with a bunch of HTML tags, tags are these point-bracketed enclosed words that mean something special to the browser, let&amp;rsquo;s actually make a HTML file right now to get started.</description>

Want to make a button that increments a counter?
Click me

      <description>Setting up everything you need to make a website # [TODO] - include instructions for GitHub pages, a VPS, and self-hosted but assume a Hugo site for all three. There&amp;rsquo;s gotta be limits in the complexity somewhere, and I draw the line at setting up everything for decent JS web app dev / PHP shit, cloud/AWS, etc. though I still want to link to external resources for those things. Also, this probably needs to be written for win/mac/lin, which means there will have to be a ton of permutations of getting things setup depending on hosting solution and OS.</description>

      <description>The Basics of Art and Design # When you&amp;rsquo;re first learning art, every art class will beat a few core ideas into your head:
Lines - The &amp;lsquo;structure&amp;rsquo; bits of the works, when you start making art, you&amp;rsquo;ll often start with the Line Art
Shape - Structures that form out of lines, might appear 3D. These might be mathy, like squares, or organic, like an eye
Form - Mostly applicable to 3D (or art interpreted as 3D) - Think of this as the shape you&amp;rsquo;d see if you could move around the object in real life</description>

This book is pure gold. It&amp;rsquo;s about the written word, but will help any artist just as much. It is probably the most beautiful, lovingly hand crafted book I have ever read. It&amp;rsquo;s full of character and art and beauty and words of wisdom that will make you think about what it means to be an Artist.</description>
