      <description>3D Modeling, Sculpting, Painting, Shading, and Rendering #  This chapter will be using various programs, not all of which are free. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to recommend things that are open source if I can, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep the cost down as much as possible. You definitely can do everything in this chapter for free, just be aware that without some of the paid tools it may be substantially harder.</description>

      <description>The Basics of Art and Design #  When you&amp;rsquo;re first learning art, every art class will beat a few core ideas into your head:
  Lines - The &amp;lsquo;structure&amp;rsquo; bits of the works, when you start making art, you&amp;rsquo;ll often start with the Line Art

      <description>Generative Art #  This page is almost completely devoid of actual educational content. Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to make the most complete list of generative art tools and libraries on the internet. Of course, I can&amp;rsquo;t actually make an exhaustive list and may be missing some of the newest tools and ideals, so please check out these other communities for more:  r/proceduralgeneration
r/generative
r/PlotterArt
  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in generative music and sounds as well, you may want to check out The OpGuides page on Music Software.</description>
