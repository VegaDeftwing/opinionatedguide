<h1 id="opinionated-music">Opinionated Music.</h1>
<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>My name is Vega. I know there are plenty of tutorials and ways to learn online be it on YouTube, SkillShare, or online classes provided for free by various universities. The difference here is there is no bullshit, no babysitting, and lots of bias as a result of personal experience. My views of things like what music software is bad or what equipment you should buy to learn with will be expressed directly and bluntly. This isn't to say I won't explain my reasoning, just that I'm not going to be apologetic when I say a lot of the audiophile gear is trash or that hating on digital music is misguided - though I will still likely talk about these things.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>Here's the part where I'm supposed to explain how to read music or something boring like that. Really though, that's not why you're here. So let me start by giving you a bit of motivation. In a bit I'll be going though how to use VCV Rack, a free (with paid addons, but those aren't necessary) program for making music. But as we go though each bit is going to look so -basic- that it's hard to see the bigger picture. So, here's that bigger picture: This track was made entirely with VCV rack:</p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3503666064/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/track=3864536185/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://vegadeftwing.bandcamp.com/album/content-2">Content by Vega Deftwing</a></iframe>

<p>Alright, with motivation out of the way, let's make some noise! To do that though we're gonna need just a few things:
Go download VCV Rack from https://vcvrack.com/ and depending on your OS you'll need some sound drivers, MAC guys, sorry, no idea. On Windows you'll want to use ASIO, if you don't know what that is just go grab http://www.asio4all.org/ and use that, on Linux you'll want to use Jack https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit. On Linux you may need to use a tool like Catia to actually connect the jack devices together (VCV to System Out)</p>
<p>Go ahead and fire up VCV and a template patch should have opened up that looks some thing like this:
<img alt="vcv1default" src="/opmusic/vcv1default.png"></p>
<p>Windows guys, set your sound device to ASIO and fiddle around until you have sound working, Linux people RTFM, Mac people ヽ( ´¬`)ノ.
That default patch should respond to input when you mash keys so you can test your sound settings (assuming the MIDI-CV module is set to QWERTY keyboard as in the above screenshot and an audio device has been selected)</p>
<p>Final note on that, sound cards and their drivers/software (asio/jack/etc.) have a few important settings you should know about. First, is the 'buffer size'. Frankly, this isn't all the important to understand from a technical perspective but the gist is the lower the buffer size the lower the latency, and higher the higher the latency (latency is how long it takes for sound to come out after you hit a key and is bad); however, the lower the buffer size the more likely you are to have audio under runs, this makes your sound do this weird robotty sound like it was recorded on an Atari2600, make nasty beeps, or cut out entirely. The size you can set your buffer to will vary depending on the hardware you have in your computer, but generally I can get away with 128 and I'll bump it up to 256 when working on large projects if I notice the above issues. You may need to try up to 512 or 1024 though.</p>
<p>Alright, that pita outa the way, lets <em>actually</em> make some noise.</p>
<p>The reason we're starting in VCV rack is it exposes a lot of the raw ideas and fundamentals of how music works behind the scenes, raw frequencies and modulation open to see. In that default patch there we start with a MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) input which outputs a 'voltage' from the V/oct (Volt per Octave) output, which is fed into an VCO's (Voltage Controlled Oscillator) V/oct input.</p>
<p>Wait. Big words. Stapphh.</p>
<p>Alright. I'll backup So VCV rack actually emulates real hardware systems called modular synthesizers. VCV emulates the Eurorack standard of modular synths in particular. Skipping some finer details for a moment, the standard defines one nice thing, and that's the idea of 1 Volt per Octave note control. (If you don't know anything about electronics that's fine, but it might help here) In a real eurorack system the voltage running though the wires can range from -10 to +10Volts. Any wire can really be patched into any hole to get surprising results and all the signals are technically interchangeable, but generally in eurorack there are two categories of signals CV or 'Control Voltage' and 'Audio Rate' signals. The most common form of CV is this V/oct signal, where each volt represents a one octave change. A stable 0v (the same as no input) signal is 'Middle C' or C4 where 'C' is the note and '4' is the octave number. This is only 'generally' the case, but just stick with it for now. When you strike a key on your keyboard VCV is interpreting that keypress as a MIDI event, and converting that MIDI signal to a virtual CV signal. So, if you happen to press the C note on the 4th octave, you'll get... 0v, no change, but if you were to hit the C note one octave higher (C5) the note should be noticeably higher pitch and the output from the V/oct port would be 1V. In fact because of how our music system works, an octave is exactly a doubling in frequency so while 'C4' is 261.63Hz 'C5' is 523.25Hz). If you hit a C#5 note though the output voltage will be  1.08333V because there are 12 notes per octave (A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#) and 1/12 is .08333 which is added to the 1V from being up one octave from from middle C (C4)</p>
<p><img alt="Stinkbomb" src="/opmusic/Stinkbomb.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is Stinkbomb's hardware Eurorack. Real Eurorack hardware is incredibly expensive!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright. Fuck that's complicated. So, to boil that into a digestible chunk, you press a higher key, a higher voltage comes out, lower key, lower voltage. Keys above C4 will output a positive voltage, keys below a negative voltage.</p>
<p>So we hit a key, voltage comes from V/oct on the MIDI-&gt;CV interface and goes to the Voltage Controlled Oscillator, which, as it's name suggests uses these voltages to control how it oscillates (moves). The V/oct input directly manipulates the frequency, but there's also this big honking frequency knob just begging to be twisted. That knob can be used to make it so 0V corresponds to a different note. For example, if we right click the frequency knob to enter a value directly, and enter '440' Hz that would make 0V into an 'A4' note (A is a common reference pitch, as it's just multiples of 110Hz so it's easy to remember) Now each key will just be 'transposed' that is they'll all be shifted over a few notes.</p>
<p>You can also turn this knob to something out of tune to get things completely out of the classical scale. The fine knob below does the same thing, but gives you fine control (obviously)</p>
<p>Alright, we'll come back to the VCO later, but let's follow the signal path a bit further. The VCO has a wire coming from the Saw wave output into a VCF or 'Voltage Controlled Filter'.</p>
<p>Filters are a huge part of making good sounding music as often you'll have a good sound but it'll have too much low or high end and you just want to cut it out. This filter actually has 2 outputs, one for a 'High Pass Filter' (HPF) and one for a 'Low Pass Filter' (LPF) as the names imply, a HPF lets high frequencies though and cuts the low end and a LPF cuts the high end but lets the low though. LPFs are generally used more as usually it's more desirable to cut the harsh highs out of a sound than the humming, thumping lows. This is exactly what has been done in the default patch here. The final basic (filters get really complicated) thing you should know about a filter is how they have have a cut-off frequency. That is the point at which the filter starts cutting the sound. This is adjustable, so say with a Low Pass Filter we could set the frequency really low and only let though the lowest frequency sounds or set in nice and open to just cut out the really hissy stuff. We'll talk about more complex stuff like resonance in a bit.</p>
<p>The need for this may seem a bit weird at first, as if we're playing a note at exactly one frequency, say A at 220Hz, then why would we need to filter out anything? Well, most oscillators and real instruments alike will actually have multiple 'harmonics', that is it will play an A at 220, 440, 880, and so on with decreasing amplitude or even on other frequencies entirely that still have a musical influence on the signal. On the 'VCO-1' Oscillator loaded into the default patch here you can lessen these harmonics by switching the ANLG (Analog) and DIGI (Digital) switch on the right. This is because this oscillator can emulate either an 'ideal' digital oscillator which outputs a clean, sharp signal with less harmonics or an analog signal oscillator which includes a subtle amount of pitch drift and some smoothing of the output wave- of note, usually the analog characteristics, while technically flaws, are desirable.</p>
<p><img alt="harmonics" src="/opmusic/harmonics.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The top VCO is outputting an 'analog' emulating signal while the bottom is in digital mode. Look at how the Triangle output shape on the analog mode is smoothed out compared to the digital mode's sharp edges</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll also notice there's a third wire running into the filter though- into an input labeled 'freq'. This input modulates the filter's cut off frequency. You wont visually see the knob change but you will hear the filter's cut off change based on the signal applied to this input but only if the 'Freq CV' knob is turned up. The 'Freq CV' knob is what's known as an attenuverter (a portamento of 'Attenuator' and 'Inverter'). This knob, when facing dead center says 'let nothing though' while all the way right lets the full signal (from the freq input) though, and all the way left lets the full signal though but inverts it first. Leaning right but not all the way will 'Attenuate' or weaken the signal first. I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>So say we put the big 'FREQ' knob dead center, and give the 'FREQ' input jack wire carrying a very slow sine wave that goes between 0 and 10V, and set the 'FREQ CV' knob all the way right: This will bring the cut off higher and higher from it's starting position, and then bring it back to the starting level. If we instead turn the 'FREQ CV' knob all the way left, it'll bring the cut off frequency lower before turning back around and coming to it's starting position. Putting it at a slight lean right will still do the same as we started with, but will have less of an impact, making the sound much less 'jumpy' and tame. Really, that's what attenuverter's are for, taming an input signal.</p>
<p>Here, I'm showing modulating the filter frequency manually as well as showing what resonance is- it boots the signal right at the cut off frequency</p>
<p><img alt="filter" src="/gifs/filter.gif"></p>
<p>Here, the input to the cut off frequency is modulated with an 'LFO' or Low Frequency Oscillator, which much like the VCO outputs a simple signal, but in this case the signal is low frequency, usually below human hearing range:</p>
<p><img alt="lfofilt" src="/gifs/lfofilt.gif"></p>
<p>Alright, that's fine and all, but the cable going input to the 'FREQ' control on the VCF is coming from something called an 'ADSR'</p>
<p>So the adventure continues. 'ADSR' stands for 'Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release' and it does exactly that. But before we understand the output of an ADSR we have to look at it's input- 'Gate' and 'Retrig'</p>
<p>'Gates', in modular, are simply a positive (sometimes needing to be 5V or higher) signals that represent that something is happening. Usually, that a key is being held. And that's exactly what's going on here. When you hold a key the 'Gate' output of  the MIDI-&gt;CV module is active. When you release it, the output goes off. You can see this by looking at the green indicator light where the gate output is on the MIDI-&gt;CV module when you hold or release a key. 'Retrig' is similar, though it only outputs a short pulse every time you press a key. This is handy because you may press a second key while already holding one key, meaning the gate output should stay on, but the retrig output will have sent a pulse each time you pressed a key (once when you pressed the key your holding, another time when you press a different key while still holding the original key).</p>
<p>So, back to the 'ADSR' an ADSR generates a signal that looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="adsr" src="/gifs/adsr.gif"></p>
<p>That is, voltage will follow this shape over time. The 'Attack' knob sets how long it takes to reach the peak point, the Decay knob set's how long it will take to reach the sustain level, the sustain knob set's at what level the sustain should be held at, and the release knob set's how long the note should take to fade out from the sustain level after the key is released. Take note, the sustain knob controls a level, while the other three control time:</p>
<p>Alright, so when the ADSR get's a gate signal it'll go though the Attack and Decay stages and wait at the Sustain level until the Gate is released or a Retrig signal is sent telling the ADSR to repeat the Attack and Decay stages.</p>
<p>So, this output signal is fed to two places, the first is the frequency knob we saw before. This will result in the frequency cutoff going high then coming down to a reasonable level, then cutting down to just low frequencies as a note is released. The other place the signal goes is into the mixer:</p>
<p>The mixer in this demo patch is super simple. It has 4 inputs, with one output. The sliders let you set the level of each input, and the 'CV' input of each slider let's you externally control the slider. Because the ADSR is fed into this input and the ADSR output is at 0V unless you hit a key the mixer actually mutes the signal until a key is pressed and then lets it play, fading out over the release period. The mixer also has one big volume knob ontop to set the master output volume of all 4 channels combined. Essentially the volume follows this shape of the ADSR signal over time. In times like this, the ADSR signal is called the 'envelope' for the sound. Really, the mixer is just a combination of multiple of a simpler component though, the VCA or Voltage Controlled Amplifier. This name is a bit misleading though, as really VCAs are usually used to bring a sounds volume down, like an attenuator. To show the simplest case I'll hook up a LFO to control a VCA's level, in turn changing the level of the signal passing though:</p>
<p><img alt="vcavult" src="/gifs/vcavult.gif"></p>
<p>Also, above you'll see I used a 3rd party oscillator instead of the VCO-1 you've seen so far. Pictured is 'Basal' from the 'Vult-Free' collection of modules available on the VCV library page.</p>
<p>Finally, the output of just the first channel of the mixer is fed into the scope so that when you press a key you can see the signal your generating. To understand this it's easiest to just drag the cable coming out of the VCO's 'SAW' output to the VCO's 'Sine' Output. Now when you press a key instead of seeing a saw wave you should see a sine wave.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to mention that at least by default this setup is 'Monophonic' (Mono = One , Phonic = Voice) meaning that even if you hit 2 keys at once you'll only hear the note from the last key you pressed. We'll explore Polyphonic (Many Voice) and Paraphonic (Para = beside, or side by side) systems later.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>I'm going to be honest. I can't read music and I don't know scales. Why, then, would I in any way think I'm qualified to write anything about music? Well, let me stop you right there, I'm not. I make music for fun. However, I like to think that people enjoy my music and I enjoy listening to it myself as I make it, and though my experience I've picked up a little here and there to make sure things don't sound awful. Furthermore, my background is primarily technically and there's actually an insane amount of overlap with the incredibly technical and music. Fundamentally music is just doing math with frequencies after all.</p>
<p>Our ears are weird. They're incredibly good at math. We hear things logarithmically, that's why 10watts of speaker output power is only about twice as loud as 1watt and we can tell if two notes are even slightly off a perfect ratio even if we're not thinking about it. (If you hear one tone at 220Hz and another at 441Hz, only 1hz off of correct, you'll probably be able to tell)</p>
<p>Out ears also like integer divisions of musical ratios- I'm sure you've heard the term 'perfect fifth'. And though our lives our ears get accustomed to hearing and feeling things associated with chord progressions. Even someone whose never written music or tried to learn anything about music theory can pick up on how a chord with more complex ratios creates tension that begs to be resolved to something simper (Think the Duuun-uh of the Jaw's theme).</p>
<p>On the other hand perfection is boring, our ears and minds beg for stimulation, for surprise, for shock. Drums make complex sounds, that, while tuned, aren't playing a constant note and we want our music to have sufficient progression, not just repeat the same sequence endlessly. A gnarly drop in some Dubstep or the cannon fire in the 1812 Overture both serve functionally a similar purpose.</p>
<p>The most common scale worldwide, the chromatic scale, uses 12 notes in an octave tuned to an equal temperament [TODO link] as to make as many chords as possible sound good is by far the most common but only one of an infinite ways that music can be represented. On the extreme end is Microtonal music, such as is possible on fretless [TODO link guitar, and this keyboard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APtJsaPxNgo] instruments. Furthermore, our choice of centering out keyboard with A set to 440Hz is relatively arbitrary (not that it's a bad thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKTZ151yLnk).</p>
<p>In the chromatic scale there are many other, more 'refined' scales like Minor, Major, Pentatonic, etc. These scales may be transposed to be centered around any note (or any frequency, since notes are just agreed upon frequencies and the ratios between them)</p>
<p>And honestly? That's about all you need to know. Basically music is math and math makes music.</p>
<p>Oh, and the circle of fifths is a thing [TODO]</p>
<p>[TODO] Just V equal Temperament here is confusing</p>
<h2 id="back-to-vcv-rack">Back To VCV Rack</h2>
<p>Now that we have that mess out of the way let's talk shop and drop back into our rack. This time Let's start with a mostly clean slate. Make sure you can still get sound out, then remove every module except the Audio module. Alrighty, now we can get to business.</p>
<p>Let's make a simple generative track, to start with we'll need some drums. Here's what we'll be setting up:</p>
<p><img alt="drumpatch" src="/opmusic/drumpatch.png"></p>
<p>So first, let's break each module down by function. The uGraph module (2nd on left) is a generative trigger sequencer, it generates drum rhythms for us. It has it's own built in clock, but an external clock signal can be provided (turn the clock knob left until it says <em>Ext.</em> then provide a clock input that's multiplied by the rate specified in the clock res box, in this case it wants 4ppqn or peaks per quarter note, so, if you want to a 120 bpm drum line, you'll want to send a clock signal that's multiplied by 4. Some modules will sync on 1ppqn or 24ppqn, etc. So, just be aware that you may need to multiply your clock signal some times.) though here we'll use the internal clock. This module sends out 6 triggers, where the three 'accent' (Acc) triggers are a strict subset of the main trigger outputs, that is there will only be an output on Acc when there is an output on Trig, but not always. uGraph will generate the three trigger sequences such that the left most trigger output 'fires' the least often and the right most the most often. This works well for setting up a common drum machine with kick, snare, and hat sounds so that the hats are frequent, the snare less so, and the kick a steady beat, but not overpowering. Of course, this isn't how you have to use it, and you can always add more trigger output patterns in VCV simply by sending two uGraph modules the same clock. Again, for now one module is fine. Finally, it's notable that this pattern will repeat, but a new pattern can be selected with the Map X and Map Y knobs.</p>
<p>Alright, so uGraph is generating the drum triggers, think of it like the human swinging the drum sticks, but with only uGraph in there's nothing to hit. so let's add the basics. Grab a small Nysthi Mixers as pictures 2nd to last above and hook it up to an audio module as well. Then, grab the Erica PicoDrums module and place it in. Now, hook up two of the trigger outputs to the picoDrum's TR1 and TR2 trigger inputs, take the PicoDrums output to the mixer. After turning down the mixer module's master out a bit to make sure you don't play too loud of a sound, hit 'run' on the uGraph module. Currently, both of the drum sounds on the PicoDrum are set to the same sample, so you'll want to move the big 'ctrl' knob at the top to select a different sample on drum1, then switch to drum2 with the switch, and pick a good sample for drum two as well. You should now have a good drum pattern started!</p>
<p>The problem with the PicoDrum module is that it has some baked in drum sounds that can't be changed (well, okay, the real eurorack version they can be, which actually makes it a good value, but I digress) but the sounds are still samples, that is they're just audio files being trigged to be played back. So, why not use something where we can pick our own sample?</p>
<p>You'll need some drum samples to get started, so just to get you started here's a decent sample pack: https://soundpacks.com/free-sound-packs/nyc-drum-kit/</p>
<p>Download, extract, etc. that folder and in VCV place the 'Player' module as pictured above. Right click the module, select 'Load Sample', and use one of the sounds in the folders. You should now be able to trigger the player module and get sound out of it the same as the PicoDrum module. You can mess with some of the controls to get a feel for what you can do with the player Module. If you're having fun with that, you may want to look at the 'Simpliciter' module from Nysthi for an even more advanced sampler (also check the "samples" section below).</p>
<p>All of this is cool and all, but we're just playing back and manipulating sound files so far, so, let's look at the next type of drum: synthesized drum. Synth drums can be made to sound very close to real drums (this is generally called physical modeling, you'll hear the term a lot more for string synth sounds though) but can give sounds that no real drum would be capable of either. In the patch above I have 'Meta' from starling generating a low bass drum sound, but you can generally tweak synth drums into whatever sound you want, albeit some module will be better at different sounds, for example Vult's 'Trummor' modules excel at kick and bass drums. You can also make synth drums from basically anything just by thinking about the sound a drum makes. Generally, a drum is just a sound with a really sharp attack and a pitch that changes at it releases, so, this, while not the best, is a decent drum sound:</p>
<p><img alt="SynthDrum" src="/opmusic/SynthDrum.png"></p>
<p>anyway, so now the last relevant part of the above patch worth understanding is the slew is just making it so we get a nice envelope generated by the Acc output, that slew is changing the pitch decay time on the synth drum (Meta) so that on accent outputs the low drum lasts a bit longer and has a slightly different sound. Just look at the signal on a scope in VCV if you don't fully get it.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>A sample is exactly as the name implies- a 'sample' of audio. Sample is a pretty broad term though, so usually some more terms are applied to help categorize them. The easiest to explain is what is usually meant by sample: a small audio file that contains one sound, like one drum hit or one piano key press. These can either be samples made or collected for the sole purpose of use in later music (like hitting record, playing one drum hit, then stopping, to create a small drum sample) or a sample lifted (with often dubious legality) from another recording. It's worth noting that fair use is really not something you can rely on here, but it's also pretty common. #notlegaladvice</p>
<p>The next kind of sample worth looking at is a loop. These are longer and are usually, well, loopable. If you play them on repeat they typically sound continuous. Often these will be of drums or guitar. The term 'loop' is often used broadly for audio snippets of this length though, so not all loops loop. Usually when using a loop it's best to do some mangling, swapping some beats or putting on destructive effects to transform it in some way. This prevents your audio from just sounding like layered tracks from another artist mashed together and is a good way to put creativity into what you make.  </p>
<p>Another term you might hear are stems. Stems are just separate recordings of each part of a song - say the vocals as one audio file and the drums as another, these would make up the stems. </p>
<p><img alt="wavfile" src="/opmusic/wavfile.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zoomed in view of the snipped, showing the individual points in the sample</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samples are also, sort of ironically, made of samples. But these words mean two different things in that sentence. The sample of sound is made up digitally of a bunch of different points in a wave, usually captured ~44 thousand times a second- whatever the sampling rate is (commonly 44.1, 48, or 96 [^Nyquist theorm]). This is what gives us the image above, where the originally pretty smooth looking wave, when zoomed in, we can see is made of these discrete points. This is particularly relevant to making music for multiple reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>When change the speed/pitch by a non integer value, we have to 'interpolate' extra points into this.</li>
<li>When we slow down or make a sample lower pitch there's only so much data to use, at really low pitches the wave will start to sound sort of low-fi</li>
<li>When chopping a sample to start playback at any point, we want to chop at a 0-crossing to avoid a sharp transition (which equates to high pitch sound)</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>Here, we're looking at the sampler device in in Bitwig Studio, though most of this should be similar in other software. Starting with the obvious, the sample wave form in the middle. Here I have loaded a sample ([TODO, new picture, .wav]) which has multiple drum sound in it, but I've zoomed in on one sample and placed these yellow flags to denote the start an end points. Bitwig's sampler, like many others, will try to snap these points to aforementioned zero crossings.  You'll also see next to the file name that the keyboard icon is blue and says 100% and next to that the root is set to C3. This means that if I play the C3 key on my keyboard it will play the sample as is, but if I play a different key it will slow playback down or speed playback up to match the pitch to the key I'm playing. The root being C3 is because, say I hit and recorded the A4 key on my piano- it's nice to be able to correct for the pitch of the sample in the keyboard tracking.</p>
<p>Still in the same section of the window but at the bottom now you'll see two icons for the flags with '[TODO]' time between them and after them, these are the times in the sample where the start and end flags are placed. Left of that you'll also see an arrow with an R over it, that's the button to tell it you want to play the sample in reverse.</p>

<p>Frequency Modulation or FM, is just the simply when you let the output of one oscillator modulate the frequency of another oscillator. Usually this is done in simple ratios and, ideals, uses linear, through zero modulation.</p>
<p>First, Let's start with linear vs exponential FM. It's worth noting that most pitch tracking is exponential since our music system itself is inherently exponential (each octave is a doubling, that is the frequency between C5 and C4 is twice the frequency between C3 and C4). This causes a problem though, if we modulate with exponential FM, say with a sine wave that is +/- 1V (2Vpp) and we start with an A4 at 440hz, then we'll swing up to 880hz and down to 220hz. Fine right? Not so much. If this modulation is meant to simply give us a more harmonically interesting A as we mix in different octaves that won't be the effect, as now we're (to oversimplify) at 880hz half the time and 220hz half the time, and if we average those <span class="math">\(\frac{880+220}{2}\)</span> then we don't still get the original A 440hz but rather we get 550Hz, so, we've detuned. Linear FM won't be able to follow the V/Oct standard (though some may use the Hz/V standard) but will keep you in tune as you modulate. This, however, begins to pose a more interesting problem. Imagine you want to modulate a 100hz signal by +/- 200hz. Clearly, that would mean going as high as 300hz, but what happens when we get past the first half of that negative signal and hit 0hz? Well, this is where having a Though Zero FM (TZFM) capability comes in handy, as this issue is solved sonically by actually inverting the phase of the signal when crossing the 0Hz point. While this may seem an odd solution, it does produce sounds that line up with what our ears expect.</p>
<p>Exponential FM and V/Oct, assuming the same scaling, are the same thing though so sometimes you can actually view it more as a second V/Oct input. For example, you could use the Exp FM input to specify the note, and then the normal V/Oct input to change the octave. Of note however, this may not always work as the Exp FM input may be AC coupled, meaning that DC values, like note data, will not be able to get through and instead you'll just hear a "ping" as the pitch is modulated at the cutoff of the AC coupling filter, in these cases the Exp FM input will have a minimum frequency that the input signal can oscillate at to perform properly. </p>
<p>When talking about Linear FM, I mentioned that simple ratios are best. This isn't entirely true, but they will produce the least complicated harmonics. For example taking</p>

<h2 id="audio-effects">Audio Effects</h2>
<h3 id="tremolo">Tremolo</h3>
<p>This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically, usually pretty fast and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect. In VCV this can be done as simply as hooking up an LFO to a VCA's CV input like we did here, but turning up the frequency of the LFO-2 module (note, that here there is no bias so the volume does actually cut out):</p>
<p><img alt="vcavult" src="/gifs/vcavult.gif"></p>
<h3 id="vibrato">Vibrato</h3>
<p>Vibrato as an effect requires pitch shifting, which I suppose actually makes it akin to FM synthesis as described above, regardless, it's as simple as applying a, typically subtle, pitch 'wobble' into the sound. On a guitar this may be done with a pedal but more simply just by bending the string back and forth with the fingers.</p>
<h3 id="delay">Delay</h3>
<p>Delay is basically echo. Take a sound in, and repeat it it it. Normally the main controls on a delay are 'Time', which controls how long of a delay there is before each repeat, 'Feedback' which controls how much the level is reduced each time the delay repeats (and in turn, how many audible repetitions there are), and 'Dry/Wet' which controls how the signal is blended, entirely dry will have no delay, entirely wet may even miss the initial sound adding a weird latency before you hear what you're playing. Some delays have additional controls, obviously I can't cover every possible delay, but I'll try to cover most:</p>
<p>Some delays instead of letting you set a delay time or 'tap' a delay tempo in actually synchronize to a clock signal input which lets the delayed repetitions always be in time with the rest of the song.</p>
<p>Stereo delays many have additional controls as well, most commonly offering a different delay time for the left and right channels. often a 'Ping Pong' mode will also be available where the left and right speaker alternate for the echo'd sound- 'ping' and 'ponging' out each side until the sound cuts out.</p>
<p>Some delays may also allow for unity or higher feedback, which will cause the delay to be infinite or, if above unity, infinitely grow in volume until it's just a distorted clipping mess. This can actually be a lot of fun to play with.</p>
<p><img alt="Chronoblob" src="/opmusic/chronblob.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick Reference Card for the Chronblob^2 from Alright Devices, http://docs.alrightdevices.com/chronoblob2-manual.pdf </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some delays let you also insert other things into the feedback path. This means you could do things such as having each repetition be progressively more filtered, cutting out more and more high end each time or putting a delay in the delay. (yo dawg, I heard you like delay?).</p>
<p>Some digital delays and most analog delays (especially bucket brigade delays<sup id="fnref:BBD"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:BBD">2</a></sup>) can produce interesting sounds if you change the delay time while audio is going through the buffer, resulting in a sort of pitch shift <em>whip</em> sound as the delay catches up or slows down.</p>
<p>While not strictly something to do with delay, it's also worth noting that by making delay time very short and having gain near unity, sending a brief trigger (impulse) can make a sound that sounds like a string being plucked. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus–Strong_string_synthesis">Karplus-Strong Synthesis</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Quadravox" src="/opmusic/KarplusStrong.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Karplus-Strong Synthesis in VCV rack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that there are a few interesting features some delays may have, such as letting the delay buffer be frozen to infinitely repeat what was playing at the time (unity gain, ignore input), reverse'd delay - having the initial sound play forward but each repeat play in reverse, pitch shifted delay- having each delay affected by a pitch shift, often done with octave up/down. Often, this pitch shifting is done via Granular Synthesis, as mentioned above. Using granular synthesis does allow for some other interesting options though, such as <a href="https://www.unfilteredaudio.com/collections/plug-ins/products/sandman-pro">Unfiltered Audio's Sandman Pro VST</a>.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="loopers">Loopers</h3>
<p>Loopers are most commonly seen in hardware and can be seen as a sort of mix between samplers and delays. Essentially you just tap in when you start playing, play what you want, then tap out, then, the loop of whatever you played will play back to you. There may be additional settings, such as a half speed effect.</p>

<h4 id="low-pass-filters">Low Pass Filters</h4>
<p>Low Pass filters do what you think, they let the low frequencies pass and cut out the high frequencies. As with most filters, this will typically not be a sharp cutoff but instead be a gradual fading of the higher frequencies. Despite this, there is still a point called the cut off frequency, which is defined as the point where the signal is cut by 3db (what this means is discussed below). It's also pretty common for Low pass filters to have some resonance, where the frequency right at the cut off has a bit of a bump, as can be seen in this gif:</p>

<h4 id="high-pass-filters">High Pass Filters</h4>
<p>High pass filters act pretty much the same as low pass filters, except they do they cut the lows and pass the highs. High pass filters are ironically often actually used to give a bump in the bass using the resonant peak.</p>
<h4 id="band-pass-filters">Band Pass Filters</h4>
<p>There's two kinds of bandpass filters, one, is a Lowpass and Highpass filter in series, where there's only a band left that can pass giving two potential resonant peaks, and then theres band pass filters which are more 'true' band pass filters that have a resonant peak in the middle.(need to confirm this)</p>
<h4 id="notch-filters">Notch Filters</h4>
<p>Again, as the name implies, notch filters create a notch in the sound. Often used to correct for an issue in the sound, such as removing a 60hz hum. In Notch filters the resonance control actually changes how steep the notch is, so low resonance (Low Q) will cause the notch to be wider as the slope isn't very steep, but a high resonance (Q) will let you really pick out a specific frequency.</p>

<p>Flanger works by taking a <strong>very</strong> short delay* which slowly modulated delay time and mixing this back with the original signal. This will result in some phase cancellation effects and give a similar sound to a phaser. The delay time modulation rate and depth, and delay feedback are the most commonly exposed controls. Flanger is probably most commonly used as an effect on guitar.</p>
<p>*note, that delay, in this context, means an actual time delay, just a buffer that makes sound take longer to get through if that makes sense. Of course, with feedback and mixing the original this will have the same effect as a delay in the 'echo' sense.</p>

Compression can mean multiple things when talking about music and sometimes this makes talking about it sometimes confusing. Usually, when talking about compression the meaning is for compression that changes the <em>dynamics</em> of the audio, making loud sounds quieter and quiet sounds louder sort of ~squishing~ the sound. The other, unrealetd, definiton of compression is data compression, for example .mp3 vs .wav. We'll go into that later.</p>
<p>Usually compression has a few basic attributes that are relevent:</p>
<p>The 'Threshold' is what level the compressor has to be over to do anything at all. 'Attack' is the time it takes for the signal to be affected. All compressors will have some minimum attack time if they're happening live (there are some compressors with 'Lookahead' that solve this problem) which lets the transients (sharp changes) of louder sounds, like the start of a drum hit, get through to some extent, but more attack will let more of the drum transient through. Tune to taste, release is similar idea, but controls how the compressor behaves as it falls below the treshold, letting the compressor fade out with a given time instead of having a sharp cut. Compressors can be used to make drums really stand out, give guitars a longer sustained sound, or just glue the mix together better.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist–Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Therom</a> , put very basically, just says your sampling rate needs to be twice as high as the highest frequency in your source to be reproduced exactly. Because human hearing ranges roughly from 20 to 20khz, sampling at 40khz or above should be sufficient. Unfortunately, there's more too it than that, especially as generating waves in a virtual synth can benefit in sound quality for various reason from 'oversampling' - running above 44.1 or 48khz. Unfortunately, the higher the sampling rate the more work the computer has to do.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Nyquist Theorm" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Bucket Brigade Delay is essentially a bunch of capacitors acting as the 'buckets' that are figuratively passed down the chain, moving from one bucket to the next each clock cycle, of course, this clock rate can be changed while it's running. The number of stages in a BBD determines how long of a delay you can get without having a massive determent to quality.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:BBD" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
