      <description>I will dispense this advice now # Over the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve joined a few new communities online, made a few new friends in meat space, and had a repeated conversation with my SO all about the same thing: &amp;ldquo;How can I be more like you?&amp;rdquo; (or, in one case &amp;ldquo;How can I be you&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; yikes.) This is a really weird question to get. It is simultaneously asking for life advice, placing me on a pedestal as some sort of ideal, and sort of diminishes both my personal quirks and personality and the beauty in everyone&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness.</description>

      <description>Thoughts on olin, Part 1 # Written by jan Usawi&#xA;So. Can you olin a potato?&#xA;Tonight as of starting to write this, I’ve just crossed over into August 29th, 2022, myself and a few others in the ma pona server got talking about the usage of the word olin (󱥅) towards actions, and whether or not olin can refer to love for anything other than a person. And my brain, in its normal spiderweb-weaving fashion, went running.</description>

      <description>Neography &amp;amp; Conlangs:&#xA;Constructed Information Exchange # What I want to explore on this page is the why someone might want to Construct their own language (conlang) - and/or make a new - or I guess you might say neo - script, and what we can learn from prior work. This includes everything from scripts and languages made for fantasy novels to programming languages, musical notation, and other fields that rely heavily on symbolic input methods.</description>

      <description>Rhapsodaic # Rhapsodaic is a personal philosophical conlang where the morphemes are few, the analogies are many, and the pronouns are sometimes also adverbs.&#xA;It’s a language that prioritizes conceptual content over material content; all its root words refer to emotions, and anything else can only be described in relation to those emotions. It’s a tool I’ve made and used to process hard feelings, find novel ways of conveying hard-to-phrase experiences, gain new perspectives on things I’ve taken for granted, and connect with others over the radically different ways we see ourselves and the world(s) we occupy.</description>

      <description>The Fediverse, ActivityPub, &amp;amp; The IndieWeb # If you&amp;rsquo;re as active in the same nerdy online circles I am, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard all three of these terms. There&amp;rsquo;s also a good chance you&amp;rsquo;re confused how they&amp;rsquo;re all related. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s fix that:&#xA;The Fediverse # The fediverse (a portmanteau of &amp;ldquo;federation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;universe&amp;rdquo;) is an ensemble of federated (i.e. interconnected) servers that are used for web publishing (i.e. social networking, microblogging, blogging, or websites) and file hosting, but which, while independently hosted, can communicate with each other.</description>

      <description>Other cool things that I want to promote but don&amp;rsquo;t fit elsewhere, so I&amp;rsquo;m making this list here: # Audio &amp;amp; Podcasts # Brimstone Valley Mall &amp;ldquo;The year is 1999. Lurking somewhere between Hot Topic and the food court, five misfit demons from Hell kill time inciting sin in a suburban shopping mall. When the lead singer of their band goes mysteriously missing, the demons only have two weeks to find him before they play the biggest gig of the millennium - or face the wrath of Satan herself.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4: What points contradict? # Having Low Level Access and High Level Usability. # Yeah, this is always a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s always been the dream to be able to describe in &amp;rsquo;natural language&amp;rsquo; what you want and to have the computer parse what you want, inferring intent, and do whatever you want for you, but naturally, this will never be totally possible. This point is only conflicting in the sense that it can be overwhelming- if a user has access to work in something as high as natural language and can manipulate those instructions all the way down at the assembly level, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of open space.</description>

      <description>The Way We Interact With Computers Sucks. # ASCII art morphing by Tim Holman What do you see when you sit down to work?&#xA;Is your space actually comfortable?&#xA;Does your keyboard feel like it was actually designed for human hands?&#xA;How do you access information?&#xA;How do know that information is reliable?&#xA;How do you store information in a way you can retrieve it easily later?&#xA;Do you have good tools for making content?</description>

      <description>Chapter 1: The Physical # Computers aren&amp;rsquo;t just about software, websites, and programs. As the most powerful tool that most people have access to and often one that we spend many hours a day looking at, it makes sense that we make working with that tool comfortable, straight forward, and healthy. In general, we&amp;rsquo;ve mostly sucked at this, and while some things are getting better (monitor resolution) some things have gotten significantly worse (keyboards).</description>

      <description>Chapter 5: What Might Radically Change Things? # Breaking Away from Silicon, Binary, and Traditional Architectures # Probably the biggest change in computers that we could see would be rethinking the entire idea of how a computer works. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean changing the way users interact with a system, but by having new, radically different hardware designs developers may be inspired to make things that are currently impractical.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3: What&amp;rsquo;s Else Is Needed? # Script all the things! But Not Like That™ # Computers are, generally, really good at repetitive tasks. People are, generally, really bad at telling computers what they want.&#xA;This means that developers (which, I assume, is a large portion of those still reading this) need to make systems that let users automate tasks in a more user-friendly way than they would do it.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up # In all honesty, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what everything I just wrote is about. Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of ranting, but hopefully it has been interesting. To round things off with a bit of a closing note though, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually foresee many of the things I mentioned becoming common place or many even being possible, if not simply because they&amp;rsquo;re requiring so many people to agree on standards, but there is one glimmer of hope, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of proof of uniformity.</description>

      <description>Two Conclusions # I started this series with lyrics to Cognitive Dissonance Blues, and I still feel that&amp;rsquo;s appropriate. Seeing all the amazing things, proof that we can do better. Experiments that didn&amp;rsquo;t just succeed but have actually persisted to make the lives of those that use them better is both incredibly inspiring and immensely frustrating.&#xA;We have no excuses anymore. None of these are novel or difficult problems, not even the tragedy of the commons.</description>

      <description>Finding and Accessing Information Sucks # Search sucks # If you&amp;rsquo;re like most people, you probably use Google Search, but also don&amp;rsquo;t like Google Search. Google&amp;rsquo;s search makes the entire top of the page ads, tracks you, and is just generally a bit invasive, but, you still probably use it instead of DuckDuckGo because the results often get you to what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for faster.&#xA;To some extent things have gotten better as it is gotten easier to search directly from the search bar, with more browsers supporting setting the search engine by a prefix in the url bar, so if, for example, I want to search Wikipedia and directly go to an article, I can just put a &amp;lsquo;w&amp;rsquo; before what I search:</description>

Yeah, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret that one soon enough.&#xA;Even if you got a normal office chair, if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t exorbitantly expensive it probably sucks. I did like two weeks of stressing about finding something good and thankfully finally got a good recommendation from a friend, but otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s like $500 SteelCase chair or having a bolt poke though the seat&amp;rsquo;s foam until it&amp;rsquo;s leaving a permanent indentation into your butt.</description>

      <description>TODO # Patents of Cherry MX switches as transition.&#xA;Computing Is Physical # One of the frustrating things about shopping for a computer is that we&amp;rsquo;re taught to think about their specs as strictly quantifiable. You can read something like,&#xA;The 391Q2 is 1.5x faster than the 292U3 but costs 2x as much&#xA;And make a decision based on your budget and needs, but you can&amp;rsquo;t see that speed. I mean, sure, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a difference in performance in your applications - and that&amp;rsquo;s important - but an awesome gaming computer with a keyboard covered in mysterious slime and a ball mouse from 1998 isn&amp;rsquo;t something you want to use.</description>

      <description>Improving Your Writing # [TODO] split this up for technical, fiction, and applicable to both.&#xA;And for some fun,&#xA;What if English were Phonetically Consistent? (YouTube - Aaron Alon) Finding Inspiration &amp;amp; Advice # Wonderbook has been by far the most useful thing I have read for improving my skills, and I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend it enough.&#xA;Catastrotivity, a series of short audio episodes about being an artist, while not focused on writing, proved to be quite useful too.</description>
