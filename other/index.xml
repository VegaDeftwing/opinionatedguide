turns out placing 900 resistors does not get you banned from SMD assembly service after all 😇 pic.twitter.com/3iu3zL5TLi

      <description>Other cool things that I want to promote but don&amp;rsquo;t fit elsewhere so I&amp;rsquo;m making this list here: # Brimestone Valley Mall
The year is 1999. Lurking somewhere between Hot Topic and the food court, five misfit demons from Hell kill time inciting sin in a suburban shopping mall. When the lead singer of their band goes mysteriously missing, the demons only have two weeks to find him before they play the biggest gig of the millennium - or face the wrath of Satan herself.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4: What points contradict? # Having Low Level Access and High Level Usability. # Yeah, this is always a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s always been the dream to be able to describe in &amp;rsquo;natural language&amp;rsquo; what you want and to have the computer parse what you want, inferring intent, and do whatever you want for you, but naturally, this will never be totally possible. This point is only conflicting in the sense that it can be overwhelming- if a user has access to work in something as high as natural language and can manipulate those instructions all the way down an the assembly level, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of open space.</description>

      <description>Chapter 2: The Digital # Alright, now onto the fun stuff, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve established that the physical side of how we use a computer is sub optimal, but what about how we actually do the things we do day to day? I think, for the most part, these things can be put into a few categories:
Finding and Accessing shit Looking at shit Storing Shit Transferring Shit Making Shit Finding and Accessing Information Sucks # Search sucks # If you&amp;rsquo;re like most people, you probably use Google Search, but also don&amp;rsquo;t like Google Search.</description>

      <description>The Way We Interact With Computers Sucks. # ASCII art morphing by Tim Holman What do you see when you sit down to work?
Is your space actually comfortable?
Does your keyboard feel like it was actually designed for human hands?
How do you access information?
How do know that information is reliable?
How do you store information in a way you can retrive it easily later?
Do you have good tools for making content?</description>

      <description>Chapter 1: The Physical # Computers aren&amp;rsquo;t just about software, websites, and programs. As the most powerful tool that most people have access to and often one that we spend many hours a day looking at, it makes sense that we make working with that tool comfortable, straight forward, and healthy. In general, we&amp;rsquo;ve mostly sucked at this, and while some things are getting better (monitor resolution) some things have gotten significantly worse (keyboards).</description>

      <description>Chapter 5: What Might Radically Change Things? # Breaking Away from Silicon, Binary, and Traditional Architectures # Probably the biggest change in computers that we could see would be rethinking the entire idea of how a computer works. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean changing the way users interact with a system, but by having new, radically different hardware designs developers may be inspired to make things that are currently impractical.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3: What&amp;rsquo;s Else Is Needed? # Script all the things! But Not Like That™ # Computers are, generally, really good at repetitive tasks. People are, generally, really bad at telling computers what they want.
This means that developers (which, I assume is a large portion of those still reading this) need to make systems that let users automate tasks in a more user friendly way than they would do it.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up # In all honestly I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what everything I just wrote is about. Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of ranting, but hopefully it has been interesting. To round things off with a bit of a closing note though, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually foresee many of the things I mentioned becoming common place or many even being possible, if not simply because they&amp;rsquo;re require so many people to agree on standards, but there is one glimmer of hope, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of proof of uniformity.</description>
