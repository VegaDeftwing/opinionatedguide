      <description>Other cool things that I want to promote but don&amp;rsquo;t fit elsewhere so I&amp;rsquo;m making this list here: #    Brimestone Valley Mall
 The year is 1999. Lurking somewhere between Hot Topic and the food court, five misfit demons from Hell kill time inciting sin in a suburban shopping mall. When the lead singer of their band goes mysteriously missing, the demons only have two weeks to find him before they play the biggest gig of the millennium - or face the wrath of Satan herself.</description>

      <description>The Way We Interact With Computers Sucks. #  You are on a page that is a heavy work in progress. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily stand by anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written here and this page should effectively be considered not yet published. I have decided to put it up while it is in development to encourage contributions What do you see when you sit down to work? My guess is a desk pressed against a wall, maybe a few shelves, one, maybe two monitors in front of you, and a keyboard and mouse dominating the work area of your desk.</description>
