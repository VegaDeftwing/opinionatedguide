Sets are a well-defined collection of distinct objects. A set is represented in two ways, Rooster form or Set builder form.

### Rooster form:-

In this form we show all the elements in a set in curly brackets.
For example: 
A set of odd numbers is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...)
A set of animals can be {Dog, Cow, Cat, Lion}

### Set Builder form:-

In this form we show all the elements by using a property that all the elements of the set follow.
For example:
A set of even numbers upto 10 is {x | x is even and x <= 10}
which is read as x where x is even and less than or equal to 10.

### Operations on Sets:-

#### Unions:-

A Union of two sets is a set which contains all elements of both the sets. A Union of set A and set B would be represented as, A⋃B.

For example:
The Union of Set A = {1,3, 5, 6} and Set B = {1, 2, 4, 6} is

A ⋃ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

## Complexity analsis

+recursion analysis, [P vs. NP (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX40hbAHx3s)

## Brute Force

## Data structures

trees, hashtables/maps, stacks

## Practice

Fib, some pracice logical equliv, base conversion algo, overlapping lines, matrix multiplication
