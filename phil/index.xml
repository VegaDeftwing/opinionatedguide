      <description>Philosophical Arguments #  [TODO]how to construct a phil argument
Not simply accepting &amp;ldquo;Because that&amp;rsquo;s how it is&amp;rdquo; #  I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at @292.78 on Day 132 of 12,020. I&amp;rsquo;m typing on a Dvorak, split, ortholinear keyboard in a markdown document using Arch Linux instead of M$ Word on Windows, and if you&amp;rsquo;d like you could view this document using DAT or IPFS or LBRY. I find music off the 12 tone scale interesting, and while I know 432 vs 440hz, isn&amp;rsquo;t going to open my 3rd eye, listening to microtonal or music made with just intonation is still something interesting to me.</description>

      <description>Basic Philosophy #  First, let&amp;rsquo;s start really simple- what is philosophy. Well, for one, Basically all pages on Wikipedia link back to it, so it&amp;rsquo;s obviously pretty fundamental. But, why would that be?
Here&amp;rsquo;s the head of the Wikipedia entry on Philosophy:
 Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, &amp;lsquo;love of wisdom&amp;rsquo;) is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language
 Alright, so it&amp;rsquo;s the study of knowledge?</description>

      <description>Letting Society Advance Though Art and Innovation #  I think to further address any issues we first need to look into how these issues have come to exist. In general, as a society advances new issues will arise. Computers and the Internet have shown us just how incredibly things can progress and how amazing un-hindered, open information flow can change the world. The Internet has served as an educational tool of unparalleled utility to my generation and has allowed me to learn things that I otherwise would have never had access to.</description>

      <description>Logical Fallacies (and a bit more) #  If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on the internet for more than about a quarter of a second, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely been accused of a whole host of logicall fallacies. Unfortunately, most people really don&amp;rsquo;t understand what they&amp;rsquo;re saying and often use a lot of these incorrectly. On the other hand, you also likely encounter politicians people using these fallicies on a regular basis as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to call them out on it.</description>

      <description>Religion #  [TODO] The engineering community is strangely divided, the &amp;lsquo;old guard&amp;rsquo; is actually relatively conservative and professional, but as time has moved forward it&amp;rsquo;s quite the opposite. Unsurprisingly, this correlates with religion as well. The main way this plays into politics is a general hard stance for the separation of church and state. This is in part due to a past of religiously motivated legislation negatively impacting copyright law, but also just generally an understood ideal that is beneficial to democracy.</description>
