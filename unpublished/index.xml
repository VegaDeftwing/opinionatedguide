      <description>I will dispense this advice now # Over the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve joined a few new communities online, made a few new friends in meat space, and had a repeated conversation with my SO all about the same thing: &amp;ldquo;How can I be more like you?&amp;rdquo; (or, in one case &amp;ldquo;How can I be you&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; yikes.) This is a really weird question to get. It is simultaneously asking for life advice, placing me on a pedestal as some sort of ideal, and sort of diminishes both my personal quirks and personality and the beauty in everyone&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness.</description>

      <description>Thoughts on olin, Part 1 # Post by jan Usawi So. Can you olin a potato?
Tonight (1), myself and a few others in the ma pona server got talking about the usage of the word olin (Û±•Ö) towards actions, and whether or not olin can refer to love for anything other than a person. And my brain, in its normal spiderweb-weaving fashion, went running.
As much as I love using the odd preverb here and there (sike (Û±•ú) especially), olin preverb is one I‚Äôve never gotten on board with‚ÄîI love writing, but ‚Äúmi olin sitelen‚Äù is not how I‚Äôd express that passion.</description>

      <description>List of Ideas # Post about sympy in math chapter, espically with sum and product
increasingly online spaces that are custom-built are both spreading new ideas and preventing mono-cultures AND causing people to live in completely different realities and echo chambers
Fuck consumerism, fuck hoarding, fuck status symbols, fuck plastic wrapped single use internationally shiped good, fuck single use electronics, fuck shitty electronics that are instant-ewaste
Dangerous sounds - high voltage arc clicks, hard drive clicks, loud 60hz hum, etc.</description>

      <description>WEBGL &amp;amp; MATH TESTING # This is a testing ground for different options for rendering math, signals, etc. though the website. Given the music, DSP, and signals page I really care about sine waves and FFTs. It seems the best looking, lowest CPU sine I can get is using WEBGL (as immediately below) but writing the code for it is quite cumbersome. For math itself, https://github.com/airladon/figureone/ seems to be the best bet, and and should dramatically help with the math chapters.</description>

      <description>Making a VRChat World # Step 1: What Do I Want? What Do I ùïüùï†ùï• want. # concept art, etc.
Want:
ALIVE. Things should feel alive - wind, movement, player-reactivity LIVED IN. Each area should feel like there have been people there. Papers around, things under study, etc. SOUND. Ambient environment should have original sounds from my modular, kalimba, talkbox, guitars, etc. SYTLIZED. The world should be big so poly counts need to be low and/or have LOD.</description>

      <description>React test # https://josem.co/how-to-render-a-react-component-in-hugo/ - I&amp;rsquo;d like to get https://mafs.dev/guides/get-started/installation working, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it&amp;rsquo;s possible to do so in a convenient way with Hugo. I&amp;rsquo;m really not a fan of adding react as a depedency and using that much JS anyway, but if this works it&amp;rsquo;d be worth it.</description>

The orange trail shows my movement in play space, and the blue trail shows my movement in world space.

      <description>What Else Exists? # I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer that an important part of problem solving and innovating development is connecting ideas from other, seemingly unrelated fields. Really just pick any two niche interests and try to combine them. To put my money where my mouth is, here&amp;rsquo;s three quick projects:
Cryptography and Fractals? Generative music and slime mold simulation? Domain specific JS Idea Generator # [TODO] I&amp;rsquo;d like this to have about 400 items minimum, then make each into a sentence start and end.</description>
