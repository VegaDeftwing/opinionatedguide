      <description>List of Ideas # Post about sympy in math chapter, espically with sum and product

Dangerous sounds - high voltage arc clicks, hard drive clicks, loud 60hz hum, etc.</description>

      <description>Making a VRChat World # Step 1: What Do I Want? What Do I 𝕟𝕠𝕥 want. # concept art, etc.
Want:
ALIVE. Things should feel alive - wind, movement, player-reactivity LIVED IN. Each area should feel like there have been people there. Papers around, things under study, etc. SOUND. Ambient environment should have original sounds from my modular, kalimba, talkbox, guitars, etc. SYTLIZED. The world should be big so poly counts need to be low and/or have LOD.</description>

Hand tracking &amp;amp; Haptics # Walking around # I created a Udon world to visualize infinite walking. The white lines are the limits of my play space.
The orange trail shows my movement in play space, and the blue trail shows my movement in world space.
