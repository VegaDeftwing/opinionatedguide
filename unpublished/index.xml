      <description>I read The Web Is Fucked this week, and found it interesting. the TL;DR is that the web feels smaller now, in part due to seach engines (and how they rank results - SEO, advertising) and most websites lack personality. Also FaceBook bad.
And, yeah, those things suck. The web has lost a lot of its personality, FaceBook is still a threat to democracy and a blight on the idea of human decency, and search engines do make it hard for small sites and blogs to get big.</description>
