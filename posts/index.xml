      <description>Anti Consumer #  As I walked to my car after class I could smell the ashes of a cigarette and hear the echos of a train scraping on its tracks. The cool foggy air held still beams of light. It looked like a scene from Blade runner, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like the Android&amp;rsquo;s of it&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, lusting after something to make me feel alive.
The drive home was mentally taxing.</description>

      <description>Data, Formats, Backups, and Digital Purgatory #  Yunno&#39; what really grinds my gears?
Okay, yes, the current political climate, the idea of Software As a Service, and about a thousand other things given that I&amp;rsquo;ve literally got the word opinionated in this sites name&amp;hellip;
But today, today I want to rant about digital data storage- formats, backups, and the like.
 Archival is a pain in the ass No good backup software Phone&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;PC is the fucking worst  MTP needs to die a very painful death   All the best formats are a pain in the ass  format shifting sucks, opening them sucks, patents suck https://bellard.</description>

      <description>You are on a page that is a heavy work in progress. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily stand by anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written here and this page should effectively be considered not yet published. I have decided to put it up while it is in development to encourage contributions
 [TODO] https://readhacker.news/s/4ymEz (Programs are a prison: Rethinking the building blocks of computing interfaces)
The Way We Interact With Computers Sucks. #  What do you see when you sit down to work?</description>

      <description>!&amp;gt; This page is very old and has been replaced by a new version which is more accurate, contains much more information, and is more reflective of my current views. I have left it up with minimal changes for reference.
The Future of Human Computer Interfaces and How We Work #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to start out with the pile of question&amp;rsquo;s I asked myself as I wrote this.

      <description>The year is 198x. #  I stare at my amber terminal. Hexadecimal fills my screen and my mind has become lost in the flow of 6502 assembly, as I hand optimize the code flow.
I&amp;rsquo;m interupted when I recieve a message from my friend, _Maverik, he&amp;rsquo;s excited about the ground breaking CGI in Tron.
 Nostalgia is a weird feeling. We can forget when things happened, and misttribute things to entirely different decades.</description>
