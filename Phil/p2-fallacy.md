# Logical Fallacies (and a bit more)

If you've been on the internet for more than about a quarter of a second, you've likely been accused of a whole host of logicall fallacies.

This page is going to cover a fair amount of the most common and attempt to give you examples of when they apply and when they don't: (sources are at the bottom of the page)
