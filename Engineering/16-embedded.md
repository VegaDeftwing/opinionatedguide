## Playing around - Hello World and blink

## Making an Embeded System project - 1 - Humidity Sensor

## Making an Embeded System project - 2 - MIDI Controller (with piezzo)

## Making an Embeded System project - 3 - Stepper Motor Music

adapted from floppy drives, but less expensive

## Real Time Operating Systems

RIOT-OS, MBED, etc

talk about scheduling (CFS, etc)

## Other weird and cool projects:
