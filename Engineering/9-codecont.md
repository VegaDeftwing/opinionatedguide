# Chapter 9 - Finishing up the project

> # Manifesto
>
> 1. **Everything should be a tool.** A tool transforms data without adding to its source limitations. It's a function: returns an output for a given input.
> 2. **A great tool is [ambient](https://are.na/alex-singh/ambient-product-design).** It should disappear and flow through your actions. You should never need it because it's always at your hands. You should never ignore it because it's never in your way.
> 3. **Tools should be adaptable, changeable and personalisable**. If a tool does not perfectly fit your needs, you should be able to change, mix or remove its parts.
> 4. **Data should be reusable, text-editable, human-readable.** Produces a higher chance that (1.) is passed.
> 5. **Tools should be lightweight, available and timeless.** Computing power or internet speed shouldn't be the limitation for most tasks. It works in the past and in the future.
>
> > "Only through open sources, open standards, human-readable formats and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics." ― Devine Lu Linvega

## Part 3, more advanced high level

Modify the original python program to support a pretty cli input in a pretty way to make entries and visulize the data collected, parallelize some things, finally add a config file using yaml

## Part 4, getting our toes wet with embeded systems

Finally, let's go back and add a com port to the C code and send data to an arduino (can be simulated) and a TFT to display the currently active task and time elapsed.
