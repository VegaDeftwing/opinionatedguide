# Chapter 23 - Open Source, Licences, and Copyright

## What are Open Source Licences?

An open-source license is a type of license for computer software and other products that allows the source code, blueprint or design to be used, modified and/or shared under defined terms and conditions. This allows end users and commercial companies to review and modify the source code, blueprint or design for their own customization, curiosity or troubleshooting needs. Open-source licensed software is mostly available free of charge, though this does not necessarily have to be the case.

Licenses which only permit non-commercial redistribution or modification of the source code for personal use only are generally not considered as open-source licenses. However, open-source licenses may have some restrictions, particularly regarding the expression of respect to the origin of software, such as a requirement to preserve the name of the authors and a copyright statement within the code, or a requirement to redistribute the licensed software only under the same license (as in a copyleft license). One popular set of open-source software licenses are those approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) based on their Open Source Definition (OSD).

## What is Copyright?

Copyright is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the exclusive right to make copies of a creative work, usually for a limited time. The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form. Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself. A copyright is subject to limitations based on public interest considerations. It is widely believed that copyrights are a must to foster cultural diversity and creativity.

## Why Copyright is bad?

Copyright is acceptable when it is quantifiable but many products are abstract like music, digital media. So keeping the contract fair and simple is pretty hard. Copyright is bad in terms of creativity and freedom. Because of copyright, people are restricted and their hands are tied to avoid any overlap with others. The problem turns out to be the fact that the central features of copyright are polar opposite to the things that support creativity.

Creativity is a tricky thing to understand, and more trickier to understand what animates the creative spark and why some people are more creative than others. But when creativity is quantified in money because of the ownership of that creative idea, creativity loses traction.

The reason for this? Creativity is closely linked to motivation, and humans become creative when theyâ€™re internally motivated by curiosity or interest or desire. They get demotivated and less creative, when you introduce money into the equation. Many people believe licenses and copyright is holding the creativity of humans and lacking any growth in that sector.

So unless the copyright have any fair and meaningful conditions set for every possible product and situation. It cannot be perfect.
