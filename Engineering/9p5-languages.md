# Chapter 9½ - Programming Languages

[TODO] talk about to why there are so many, pros & cons per domain, etc

## Low Level

### Assembly

[Let's Learn x86-64 Assembly! Part 0 - Setup and First Steps](https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-0.txt.html)

[Part 1 - Metaprogramming in Flat Assembler](https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-1.txt.html) 

[Part 2 - We're Writing a Virtual Machine](https://gpfault.net/posts/asm-tut-2.txt.html)

### Rust

> Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — enabling you to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.

Basically, Rust doesn't let you screw up. It enforces writing code that's safe (except when you specify you want to do something unsafe). It has a lot of other really nice features and makes using efficient data structures easy. Another really nifty thing about Rust is that it has a sort of at compile time garbage collection of sorts, for lack of a better way to put it. Read more on that [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html#memory-and-allocation).

I really recommend [A half-hour to learn Rust](https://fasterthanli.me/blog/2020/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust/) 

[Nannou](https://nannou.cc/), is a creative coding framework for Rust that's pretty nifty too.

To show the maturity, just check out https://www.redox-os.org/, a full OS written in Rust!

Also, it's worth noting Rust can be used to generate Web Assembly (more about that below)

Other sources to lean rust:

### Go

> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

The big claim to fame for go is, well `go`, which let's you do really easy threading. (https://gobyexample.com/goroutines)

### Zig

> A general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining **robust**, **optimal**, and **reusable** software.
>
> https://ziglang.org/

[Zig: A programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and clarity – Andrew Kelley (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4oYSByyRak&list=WL&index=4&t=0s)

[Writing a small ray tracer in Rust and Zig](https://nelari.us/post/raytracer_with_rust_and_zig/)



### Crystal

Crystal's big thing is a Ruby (a very fast to write language) that's compiled and fast. From the home page:

```ruby
# A very basic HTTP server
require "http/server"

server = HTTP::Server.new do |context|
  context.response.content_type = "text/plain"
  context.response.print "Hello world, got #{context.request.path}!"
end

puts "Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080"
server.listen(8080)
```

Seriously check it out at https://crystal-lang.org/



### D

A lesser used competitor to C++ mostly. It's very syntactically similar. Might be worth looking at.

https://dlang.org



### Nim

> Nim is a statically typed compiled systems programming language. It combines successful concepts from mature languages like Python, Ada and Modula.
>
> https://nim-lang.org/

Further, Nim allows for easy 'metaprogramming' which basically means you can [TODO]

Nim's syntax is python-like-ish



### Red

To be honest, I'm not sure Red belongs in the low level category, as it can be ran as a JIT language.

### Haxe

### Java & Kotlin

!> This is Opinionated Guides, so let me be clear, I really, **really** hate Java. It's a langage that didn't even become popular on it's own merit, instead Sun Microsystem paid a [fuck ton](https://www.theregister.com/2003/06/09/sun_preps_500m_java_brand/) of money to push it- hence the **"3 Billion Devices Run Java"** Thing. I'm hopeful (albeit probably naively) that Oracle (Which bought Java from Sun) making Java a mess of licencesing as the 'main' Java Virtual Machine goes [paid (Read on Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) and [suing Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.) will be the nail in the cofin for education using it and that it will die out with time.
[Criticism of Java (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Java)

don't.
but, here's why not to use Java:

### WebAssembly

> WebAssembly (abbreviated *Wasm*) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
>
> https://webassembly.org/

While not technically a programming language, I wanted to bring it up and encourage you look into it to be used instead of JavaScript for real projects. 



### Vult

### Call for Contribution

If I missed a language you think I should have mentioned or would like to write a nice guide to your language of choice to be included in this Opinionated Guide please submit a pull request. I'd love to expand the Rust, Go, and Zig sections significantly!

## High Level

[TODO] probably going to need to break this out into it's own chapter

### Python

[Cython](https://cython.org)

> **Cython** is an **optimising static compiler** for both the **[Python](http://www.python.org/about/)** programming language and the extended Cython programming language (based on **Pyrex**). It makes writing C extensions for Python as easy as Python itself.

### JavaScript

Fine. I'll talk about JS. But, please. For the love of god do not use this to make an Electron App.

Before going to far, I do want to mention that a chunk of my hatred for JS is solved using frameworks and that I totally acknowledge the utility of JS for making quick, often very cool, 'sketches'. The creative coding community is amazing. Further, JS, as much of a total dumpster fire as it is, is responsible for the Internet as it is today weather thats a good thing [or not](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/).

don't.

## For the Skript Kidd3s

> In programming and hacking cultures, a **script kiddie**, **skiddie**, or **skid** is an unskilled individual who uses [scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) or programs developed by others to attack computer systems and networks and [deface websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_defacement), such as a [web shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_shell). It is generally assumed that most script kiddies are juveniles who lack the ability to write sophisticated programs or exploits on their own and that their objective is to try to impress their friends or gain credit in computer-enthusiast communities. However, the term does not relate to the actual age of the participant. The term is considered to be derogatory.
>
> from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie

But, really, some absolutely incredible code has been written in the following languages. They more than serve their purpose and are generally some of the fastest "I just need a quick and dirty solution" options out there. Not everything needs a blazing fast hand optimized C implementation, and code that's really just for personal use, to acomplish a one-off task, or that runs inside a bigger program (3D modeling software like Blender, Video editing software like Premier, Game development editors, etc.)  should probably be easy to read and modify quickly. Rapid prototyping certainly has it's place.

Just don't think you should use these to write efficient, safe code.
