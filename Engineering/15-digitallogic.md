# Chapter 15 - Digital Logic

[Todo, insert intro about Minecraft redstone]

## What is digital logic?

ignoring the analog world (10%/90%)

### Truth Tables, K-Maps

min/max terms, Don't cares, SOP/POS, multiple out

## Basic Logic Gates

#### Not

Truth table, transistor implementation pmos/nmos, cost, power consumption at switch

#### And, Nand

#### Or, Nor, Exnor

### Xor, Exor

#### Transmission,

#### Mux, Demux, encoders

## Basic combinational logic

propagation delay, fan in/out, POS/POS 

### 2's Compliment, Floating Pt, Math

overflow, carry, ripple, fast, mul, shift-and-add mult, divider,

## Latches and Flip Flops

SR, Dl, edge triggering, Dff, Tff, JKff,

### Registers

### Counters

## Making Some Circuits

There's a ton of simulators out there for making simple circuits educationally, but most sorta suck, so I'm going to delve right into something fun: Minecraft

> If you don't own MineCraft and can't afford it, [MineTest](https://www.minetest.net) with [mesecons](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Jeija/mesecons/) is an option. It's... not great. (sorry MineTest team, I still love what you're doing <3 ) But it is Open Source. If you're using Arch Linux (and updates haven't broken things since writing) you should be able to install `MineTest` from the community repo and `mesecons-git` from the AUR.

## More Digital Logic resources

We'll come back to look at more complex digital logic in chapter 28 "Let's try out programmable logic" and **29 "Let's make our own SOC"** , but if you're hungry for even more, here are some resources
