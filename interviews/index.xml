Introduction: I&amp;rsquo;m Matthew or LoialOtter, a crazy person up in western Canada who likes to make stuff. I work at Kron Technology as an engineer mainly in FPGA, electronics design and hardware design.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any credentials except a certificate in baking and pastry arts. I&amp;rsquo;m self-taught mostly due to not being ever able to afford going to school. I suggest others do when the have the opportunity but it isn&amp;rsquo;t absolutely required.</description>
