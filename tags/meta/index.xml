      <description>Friday, September 13th # On Friday, September 13th 2024, I found a new issue had been opened on the GitHub repo for this site. This issue has since been deleted (the page 404&amp;rsquo;s) but I still have the email I got as a notification when the issue was made
Dear @VegaDeftwing: I hope this message finds you well. From ScanOSS, we are constantly reviewing open source code and noticed the use of language that could be considered vulgar or inappropriate on one of your repositories.</description>

      <description>Preface # This is a uses page.
I want to preface everything by saying I am very fortunate to have all of the stuff I have. I like my stuff. But, ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s just stuff. I know I do not use any of it to its maximum potential. It makes me happy to have it, but I also don&amp;rsquo;t need the vast, vast majority of it to accomplish the majority of what I want to accomplish.</description>

      <description>History # Before I can get into how OpGuides works now, I need to provide some history so that you can learn from my mistakes.
The first iteration of OpGuides was OpinionatedEngineering.md. A single markdown file so long that the scroll bar was hard to grab. It was meant to be viewed and distributed not as a website, but as a file to be opened with https://typora.io (so that the html and everything rendered- though in theory any markdown editor would do)</description>
