      <description>I previously wrote AI Art Panic about how this image generation stuff isn&amp;rsquo;t going to displace artists much if at all, but, uh, it didn&amp;rsquo;t age well.
I said that it was more likely to simply augment how artists work. I wrote about how it had limitations, like not being able to generate somebody&amp;rsquo;s personal character.
Small problem with that assessment:
Character is owned by me, art is by Siplick Character is owned by me, art created with DreamBooth trained model.</description>

      <description>The year is 2022. In the world of social media, Twitter has long been the platform of choice for politicians, celebrities, and everyday users alike. But as the years have passed, the once-mighty site has struggled to keep up with the rapidly changing landscape of the internet.
As the lines between the virtual and the physical world blur, Twitter becomes a battleground for hackers, activists, and corporate interests. Despite the best efforts of its engineers and executives, the site is plagued by outages and security breaches, causing frustration and anger among its remaining user base.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on the internet at all lately, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen AI generated art and discussion of the impact of the tools. You&amp;rsquo;ve also probably seen a lot of hate for AI generated art. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of drama going on, as art focused communities across the internet decide how to handle this. Does AI generated/assisted art need tagged as such? Should it be allowed at all? There&amp;rsquo;s the whole Deviant Art situation (ArsTechnica).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not being paid to say any of this, I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to any of the companies listed here except for
Noisedeck, which while is made by two really awesome people, also gets a pretty nasty review here because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for this use case. Sleepy Circuits, which I&amp;rsquo;ve only talked to. I don&amp;rsquo;t even own their hardware. Furthermore, I have paid my own money for Visual Synthesizer, Cathodemer, and KodeLife.</description>

      <description>I removed this post due to it being a downer. If you view the page source, you can un-comment it, but I have decided the hate from strangers doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.

      <title>A Meta-er-verse</title>

      <description>Plots of land &amp;amp; Euclidean space # One of the bigger points of the metaverse is the idea of owning a slice of digital property. This is a weird mix of the scarcity and value from real life property and the domain name (like myfancyname.com) market. It also makes no god damn sense in this context, and is really just artificially putting limitations into a system for the sake of making yet another crypto currency.</description>

      <title>Low Bandwidth Images</title>

      <description>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a website that you want to make use less bandwidth. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re paying by the byte for content delivery, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re worried about the environment, either way, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you want to make your images as small as possible. The obvious place to start is just shrinking your images. Here, this is a 4032x2268 .jpg shrunk down to a 1008x567 .jpg - 25% of the original quality.</description>

      <description>This paper was written for CSCE-430, Computer Architecture at University Of Nebraska - Lincoln in Spring of 2021.
This in-page view isn&amp;rsquo;t all that great, so feel free to download the pdf directly.
If you would like to read the refrenced papers, I reccomend using Sci-Hub with a VPN on, as the academic publishers putting up paywalls as barriers to science can go fuck themselves.

      <description>Most of these things probably exist. For many, it&amp;rsquo;s just that they don&amp;rsquo;t exist at a practical price point. Without further ado, In no particular order
A not garbage, not phone based, IR camera that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost a bajillion dollars
Yes. I know the FLIR and SEEK Thermal cameras are a thing, but both have their share of software problems or hardware incompatibilities. Most of all, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to hope that their app keeps working with my phone at risk of a $250 paper weight.</description>

      <description>Super brief post about one of the more fun projects I setup recently: a lil&amp;rsquo; time lapse script
#!/bin/bash CAM=$(v4l2-ctl --list-devices | grep C920 -A 1 | grep /dev | awk &amp;#39;{$1=$1};1&amp;#39;) #Uncomment the next line to verify it&amp;#39;s using the correct device #echo $CAM ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -s 1920x1080 -i $CAM -ss 0:0:2 -frames 1 &amp;#34;/mnt/data/lapse/tl$(date +&amp;#34;%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S&amp;#34;).jpg&amp;#34; I have multiple cameras on my system, but only wanted output from the better one, the C920.</description>

      <description>I use VCV Rack a lot. I normally use it on Windows as running VSTs in Linux is still a bit of a PITA and If I&amp;rsquo;m going to make music I want to have access to all of my tools. However, I still want to be able to use VCV on Linux for processing guitar when taking breaks from working on other things without having to reboot over to Windows.</description>
