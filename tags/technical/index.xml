      <description>The Background #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to jump straight to the point, after my last post, somebody saw the Arch install guide on OpGuides and decided they didn&amp;rsquo;t like it, and so opened a PR deleting the file:
Now, this story could have ended here. I could have closed the issue and moved on with my life, but as a real &amp;ldquo;I use Arch BTW&amp;rdquo; user since 2014 I&amp;rsquo;m just not okay with this attitude in the community, so&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>A Meta-er-verse</title>

      <description>.me{background-color: #333!important; }Plots of land &amp;amp; Euclidean space #  One of the bigger points of the metaverse is the idea of owning a slice of digital property. This is a weird mix of the scarcity and value from real life property and the domain name (like myfancyname.com) market. It also makes no god damn sense in this context, and is really just artificially putting limitations into a system for the sake of making yet another crypto currency.</description>

      <title>Low Bandwidth Images</title>

      <description>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a website that you want to make use less bandwidth. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re paying by the byte for content delivery, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re worried about the environment, either way, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you want to make your images as small as possible. The obvious place to start is just shrinking your images. Here, this is a 4032x2268 .jpg shrunk down to a 1008x567 .jpg - 25% of the original quality.</description>

      <description>This paper was written for CSCE-430, Computer Architecture at University Of Nebraska - Lincoln in Spring of 2021.
This in-page view isn&amp;rsquo;t all that great, so feel free to download the pdf directly.
If you would like to read the refrenced papers, I reccomend using Sci-Hub with a VPN on, as the academic publishers putting up paywalls as barriers to science can go fuck themselves.

      <description>Most of these things probably exist. For many, it&amp;rsquo;s just that they don&amp;rsquo;t exist at a practical price point.  Without further ado, In no particular order
  A not garbage, not phone based, IR camera that doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost a bajillion dollars
Yes. I know the FLIR and SEEK Thermal cameras are a thing, but both have their share of software problems or hardware incompatibilities. Most of all, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to hope that their app keeps working with my phone at risk of a $250 paper weight.</description>

      <description>Super brief post about one of the more fun projects I setup recently: a lil&amp;rsquo; time lapse script

      <description>I use VCV Rack a lot. I normally use it on Windows as running VSTs in Linux is still a bit of a PITA and If I&amp;rsquo;m going to make music I want to have access to all of my tools. However, I still want to be able to use VCV on Linux for processing guitar when taking breaks from working on other things without having to reboot over to Windows.</description>
