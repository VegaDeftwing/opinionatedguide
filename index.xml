      <description>Art by Talon Creations. Characters from Left to Right: Soatok, Cadey, Loial, Vega, Cendyne, Mimir, Vordex Ⅰ - Community # When you think engineer, what traits come to mind?&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like most people, you probably thought &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;antisocial&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;While I can&amp;rsquo;t speak to how truthful that stereotype may be, I can tell you for sure that in engineering, not knowing how to make friends, ask for help, and talk with others will make you all but useless.</description>

      <description>At the start of January, my coworker and former-roommate sent me a message with a link to a guitar kit on Temu,&#xA;[temu guitar link]Not gonna build the Temu Electric Guitar?&#xD;similar kits are on ebay and I thought about it because there were some fretless ones. They&#39;re, uh, not good.&#xD;I think the one reason to get them is the body. Throw away everything else.&#xD;lmao. I&#39;d venmo you half the cost if you buy it&#xD;And this is how we wound up here, because in return, he wanted me to write about building this Temu monstrosity.</description>

      <title>How To Communicate Over Text</title>

      <description>There are a few social ettique things that people sometimes handle incorrectly over text, much to the detrimant of their own relationships. After dealing with these so many times, I thought maybe having a source to point to that says &amp;ldquo;Not only does this bother me, but it&amp;rsquo;s bothered me enough, historically, that I&amp;rsquo;ve written exactly how, why, and how to avoid it&amp;rdquo; might help.&#xA;Rule 1: No anxious cliffhangers # we need to talk 1:12 PM Why?</description>

      <description>This page is targeted at a non-technical audiance.&#xA;Right now, AI is moving crazy fast in multiple areas:&#xA;Generating images in most any style, including photo-realistic to the point of deception This is quickly moving to include video generation as well This also includes manipulating existing images Generating descriptions of photos Generating speech from text in a way that is almost totally convincing This includes making new speech models from existing recordings of voices Generating near-human quality text responses to textual input Chat bots, obviously, - but a whole lot more.</description>

      <description>Last week I went to an airshow with the Blue Angels and yesterday I went to the Nebraska State Fair.&#xA;The Fair Scammer # My state, Nebraska, is largely agricultural, so it should be no surprise that the fair had multiple buildings stuff to the brim with animals - cattle, sheep, chickens, pigs - and while I find factory farming of the animals stomach churning, I&amp;rsquo;m also not about to stop eating meat (I guess my stomach is more powerful than my will), and either way, that&amp;rsquo;s not really what was on display here.</description>

      <description>Preface # This is a uses page.&#xA;I want to preface everything by saying I am very fortunate to have all of the stuff I have. I like my stuff. But, ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s just stuff. I know I do not use any of it to its maximum potential. It makes me happy to have it, but I also don&amp;rsquo;t need the vast, vast majority of it to accomplish the majority of what I want to accomplish.</description>

      <description>I previously wrote AI Art Panic about how this image generation stuff isn&amp;rsquo;t going to displace artists much if at all, but, uh, it didn&amp;rsquo;t age well.&#xA;I said that it was more likely to simply augment how artists work. I wrote about how it had limitations, like not being able to generate somebody&amp;rsquo;s personal character.&#xA;Small problem with that assessment:&#xA;Character is owned by me, art is by Siplick Character is owned by me, art created with DreamBooth trained model.</description>

      <description>The year is 2022. In the world of social media, Twitter has long been the platform of choice for politicians, celebrities, and everyday users alike. But as the years have passed, the once-mighty site has struggled to keep up with the rapidly changing landscape of the internet.&#xA;As the lines between the virtual and the physical world blur, Twitter becomes a battleground for hackers, activists, and corporate interests. Despite the best efforts of its engineers and executives, the site is plagued by outages and security breaches, causing frustration and anger among its remaining user base.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on the internet at all lately, you&amp;rsquo;ve seen AI generated art and discussion of the impact of the tools. You&amp;rsquo;ve also probably seen a lot of hate for AI generated art. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of drama going on, as art focused communities across the internet decide how to handle this. Does AI generated/assisted art need tagged as such? Should it be allowed at all? There&amp;rsquo;s the whole Deviant Art situation (ArsTechnica).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not being paid to say any of this, I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to any of the companies listed here except for&#xA;Noisedeck, which while is made by two really awesome people, also gets a pretty nasty review here because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for this use case. Sleepy Circuits, which I&amp;rsquo;ve only talked to. I don&amp;rsquo;t even own their hardware. Furthermore, I have paid my own money for Visual Synthesizer, Cathodemer, and KodeLife.</description>

      <description>Post originally published March 22 of 2021, date above represents most recent edit The Nebraska Union at UNL, photo by ensign_beedrill, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons At the time of writing, I am currently a student at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, where I study Computer and Electrical Engineering as a dual major. I have a serious passion for both of these subjects, which is why I am so incredibly frustrated at how negative my experience at UNL has been, especially in the classes that directly relate to my major.</description>

      <description>Quantization is the process of constraining an input from a continuous or otherwise large set of values (such as the real numbers) to a discrete set (such as the integers). - wikipedia I&amp;rsquo;m less than two months from graduating with degrees in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. One subject that comes up a lot in both fields is Quantization. Reading audio in to a micocontroller from a DAC? That continuous signal, represented physically by infinite values, now may only have 12 bits of resolution.</description>

      <description>Plots of land &amp;amp; Euclidean space # One of the bigger points of the metaverse is the idea of owning a slice of digital property. This is a weird mix of the scarcity and value from real life property and the domain name (like myfancyname.com) market. It also makes no god damn sense in this context, and is really just artificially putting limitations into a system for the sake of making yet another crypto currency.</description>

      <description>From time to time, I get asked about my religion. Sometimes, &amp;ldquo;asked&amp;rdquo; is putting it lightly, like when my SO&amp;rsquo;s father asked if I believe in a God, but made it very clear there was only one right answer if I wanted to date my SO. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m asked with honest curiosity, as when people find out I grew up in a mixture of Wicca and Christianity, people wonder how that works, and what I came out believing in.</description>

Because I know not everyone cares about all these products, I&amp;rsquo;m going to skip right to the juicy bit- the thinking about what lessons come from this thinking:</description>

Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re paying by the byte for content delivery, maybe you&amp;rsquo;re worried about the environment, either way, let&amp;rsquo;s assume you want to make your images as small as possible. The obvious place to start is just shrinking your images. Here, this is a 4032x2268 .jpg shrunk down to a 1008x567 .jpg - 25% of the original quality.</description>

      <description>The term digital native describes a young person who has grown up in the digital age, in close contact with computers, the Internet, and video game consoles, and later mobile phones, social media, and tablets. The term is often used to refer to millennials, Generation Z, and Generation Alpha; the latter two are sometimes described as distinct &amp;ldquo;neo-digital natives&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; digital natives, or &amp;ldquo;digital integrators&amp;rdquo;. &amp;lsquo;Digital Native&amp;rsquo; on Wikipedia You know how every headline about Millennials or Gen Z is &amp;ldquo;Gen ___ has killed ___&amp;rdquo; and it makes everyone from those generations want collectively bang their heads into a desk?</description>

      <description>Most of these things probably exist. For many, it&amp;rsquo;s just that they don&amp;rsquo;t exist at a practical price point.

I know the FLIR and SEEK Thermal cameras are a thing, but both have their share of software problems or hardware incompatibilities. Most of all, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to hope that their app keeps working with my phone at risk of a $250 paper weight.</description>

(yet.)&#xA;Despite my best efforts, my parents still call me by my &amp;lsquo;old&amp;rsquo; name. I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to call it a dead name, as I&amp;rsquo;m not trans. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s the same or that it&amp;rsquo;s fair to claim that it is.</description>

      <description>When I looked into the mirror this morning, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure who I was looking at. Is that me? Is that really what I look like now? Has this years long separation from reality caused me to not recognize my own face, or would it have happened anyway- a side effect of growing older.&#xA;If you saw me, would you even recognize me? Or am I the ship of Theseus, digested by the carnivore that we call time, now fertilizer for someone you&amp;rsquo;ve never met?</description>

A single markdown file so long that the scroll bar was hard to grab. It was meant to be viewed and distributed not as a website, but as a file to be opened with https://typora.io (so that the html and everything rendered- though in theory any markdown editor would do)</description>

      <description>I use VCV Rack a lot. I normally use it on Windows as running VSTs in Linux is still a bit of a PITA and If I&amp;rsquo;m going to make music I want to have access to all of my tools. However, I still want to be able to use VCV on Linux for processing guitar when taking breaks from working on other things without having to reboot over to Windows.</description>

      <description>As I walked to my car after class I could smell the ashes of a cigarette and hear the echos of a train scraping on its tracks. The cool foggy air held still beams of light. It looked like a scene from Blade runner, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like the Android&amp;rsquo;s of it&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, lusting after something to make me feel alive.&#xA;The drive home was mentally taxing. The fog so dense that cars ahead seemed to be balls of light floating in the distance and keeping sight of the lines to stay in my lane took a constant effort.</description>

      <description>3D Modeling, Sculpting, Painting, Shading, and Rendering # Art by TalonCreations This chapter will be using various programs. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to recommend things that are open source if I can, otherwise I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep the cost down as much as possible. You can do everything in this chapter for free, just be aware that without some of the paid tools it may be harder. Before we get started, let&amp;rsquo;s look at some examples of cool art made using 3D modeling and Blender:</description>

      <description>Analog Art # What makes it &amp;lsquo;analog&amp;rsquo; # For OpGuides I&amp;rsquo;m going to refer to any non-digital art as analog. Traditionally, this art is called traditional. I don&amp;rsquo;t like this term as it implies that there&amp;rsquo;s a right &amp;rsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo; way to do things, and that&amp;rsquo;s a load of shit. Whenever I say analog, don&amp;rsquo;t think about it too much. I just mean not using software and a computer, or, if using a computer, it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for the majority of the effort that&amp;rsquo;s used to make the end product.</description>

      <description>Analog Art to Digital Art # Scanning in your Analog Art # [TODO] Scanner DPI, etc.&#xA;Background Removal # Via vector art tools # Before doing this, you should know what vector art is and how it differs from the raster art you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about this a bit in the previous chapter, Digital Art . This process requires combining the two, and it&amp;rsquo;s a bit odd if you haven&amp;rsquo;t used vector art tools before.</description>

      <description>Digital Art # Photo by cece kun The primary tool of the digital artist… The pen? # I want to give you a heads-up that making digital art without a pen tablet or pen display of some sort is pretty awful. You can get a cheap pen tablet - they&amp;rsquo;re basically like a mouse pad that you use a pen on - for ~$30. Or you can get a fancy pen display, where you draw directly on the screen, for about ~$300 (akin to the one in the picture above but one that large is probably much more expensive)</description>

      <description>Generative Art # AI tools, and to a lesser extend non-AI based generative art tools, have been contentious among artists for a while now. While the reasons for the apprehension vary, two common threads come up a lot:&#xA;Is it ethical, and should it be legal, to train these systems on existing images with out consent from the artists?&#xA;This way out of scope for this page, but if you think no, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t exclude you from using all generative tools - most don&amp;rsquo;t use AI at all.</description>

      <description>Phone Photography # I, for the longest time, wanted to talk about how to take photos like a professional on this page.&#xA;I finally realized that next to nobody cares. The vast, vast majority of people just use their phone, don&amp;rsquo;t want to lug around a camera, and definitely don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend $1500 on a camera.&#xA;More over, the best camera is the one you have. So, the phone will almost always win, at least for everything except wedding days and planned trips.</description>

They&amp;rsquo;re tried and tested to make people better at art, and they apply to any piece. This is great, but I think there are a some things left out of this, I assume to make it more broadly applicable.</description>

      <description>Cost # A pretty big question you should ask right away is &amp;ldquo;How much does this cost?&amp;rdquo;, and you probably already know the answer.&#xA;It depends.&#xA;First thing you should worry about is the cost of hosting.&#xA;What Is Hosting? # If you want to, you can run a web server off of your home internet connection. This has problems though:&#xA;It means everyone will know your public IP and any attacks on your site will be attacks directly on your network This isn&amp;rsquo;t the end of the world, but it does mean you have to be reasonably smart and good about network security You can use something like Cloudflare to remedy this, but at that point, why?</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re doing something complex, such as working with animations, the syntax can get a bit weird, but with how humans don&amp;rsquo;t think about style and art in a linear way and dealing with the complexities of different devices.&#xA;How we think about style # Look around this website, there are things that are stylistically cohesive - the color theme, the way I indicate that something is a local link by putting it in a button with a color that matches where it goes.</description>

Also, this probably needs to be written for win/mac/lin, which means there will have to be a ton of permutations of getting things setup depending on hosting solution and OS.</description>

If somebody really wants to lean how to do electronics stuff, even at the hobbiest level, they need to be able to&#xA;Know how to pick parts Know how and where to order parts How to actually assemble things (a bit of mechanical know-how) Feel comfortable making things that do things Beginner projects then are a bit of a problem.</description>

      <description>37½ - Non-Silicon Computing # Most computers today use integrated circuits which use silicon as a semiconductor. This, historically, was not the only option. In the past, there were some chips made with gallium arsenide (such as those in the Cray-3) though it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be confused with gallium nitride (GaN) which are getting common use not for logic, but for power electronics. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s not just Gallium. Germanium is also a semiconductor which used to be used for transistors and diodes, and there has been modern research into using a silicon–germanium alloy.</description>

You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard this in passing, but you may not know what they are. These are Instruction Set Architectures (ISA), and they define the list of instructions your computer can understand and the basics about how those instructions are laid out.&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a fictional computer, really old, that&amp;rsquo;s only 8-bit (most modern systems are 32 or 64bit) this would mean we get eight 1&amp;rsquo;s and 0&amp;rsquo;s to define our instruction.</description>

This isn&amp;rsquo;t the chapter on voltage and current, so I&amp;rsquo;ll spare some of the details, but effectively you want a power supply that can deliver plenty of power and that has clean power. A given power supply usually has a rating like &amp;lsquo;500w&amp;rsquo; for 500 watts, but this is usually a bad indicator, as they could be referring to multiple things- you see a desktop power supply usually outputs multiple voltages (-12, +12, +5, +3.</description>

While the text only interface can look intimidating, it has some clear advantages. Namely it&amp;rsquo;s significantly faster to use the cli or &amp;lsquo;command line interface&amp;rsquo; version of many tools. Because of the nature of this guide you will be using the terminal frequently, so for convince sake a large amount of information on using it effectively has been moved to Appendix A, I highly recommend you read though it after you finish this page.</description>

Beyond the Candy Crush being bundled and privacy concerns, it&amp;rsquo;s generally just a pain in the ass- and as a Linux user, that&amp;rsquo;s saying something. That said, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably need to do some stuff with it from time to time regardless. So, in this page I want to do three things:</description>

      <description>Chapter 43 - Ham Radio # &amp;lsquo;137Mhz&amp;rsquo; by u/CashewHut Amateur or &amp;ldquo;ham&amp;rdquo; radio is a great hobby to get into for electronics minded people. You can get into the radio hobby without a license, but generally to transmit anything you&amp;rsquo;ll need to take a test to prove you know a reasonable amount about the equipment, electricity, and regulations.&#xA;Here in the US, this means taking a multiple-choice test for ~$15.</description>

      <description>Chapter 37.2 - The OSI Model # The OSI model of networking is the model of networking most classes will cover. It is slightly different from the one used by the internet, which is the TCP/IP model, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit more regularly used when talking about networking, so it&amp;rsquo;s the one I&amp;rsquo;ll cover here. Note, the big difference is really just that In the TCP/IP model, the Physical and Data Link Layers are viewed as a unified &amp;lsquo;Network Acces Layer&amp;rsquo;, the Network Layer is called the Internet Layer, The Transport Layer stays the same, and the and The Session, Presentation, and Application layer are all part of a larger Application Layer.</description>

      <description>Chapter 11 - Best Practices # Manifesto # Everything should be a tool. A tool transforms data without adding to its source limitations. It&amp;rsquo;s a function: returns an output for a given input. A great tool is ambient. It should disappear and flow through your actions. You should never need it because it&amp;rsquo;s always at your hands. You should never ignore it because it&amp;rsquo;s never in your way. Tools should be adaptable, changeable and personalisable.</description>

      <description>Chapter 10 - Let&amp;rsquo;s write some Code # Hello! If you&amp;rsquo;re here, you should know you&amp;rsquo;re on a deprecated page. All work has now been refocused on getting the new programming intro (Chapter 10 in the menu bar) to being much, much better than this page ever was. Starting Minimal # Code is mostly math # Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: Code is mostly math. If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, you probably just went ugggggghhhhhhh.</description>

      <description>Code Generation # As I said earlier, there is no way that you can write a proper compiler on your own, due to the amount of work involved.&#xA;But new languages are invented by individual people all the time. How is this possible? The answer is, they use a backend framework or library for this part.&#xA;This is the part where the Intermediate Representation (IR) comes it. It is determined by the library being used, which means the language itself can be abstracted away.</description>

      <description>Intermezzo # At this point, we have something that is ugly looking, but seems like a real compiler! After all, it does the four stages as promised:&#xA;Lexing: the splitting of whitespace and division of tokens Parsing: the creation of the syntax tree based on ordering of operations Translation: a no-op, because the syntax tree is good enough Code Generation: Python &amp;ldquo;machine code&amp;rdquo; as valid infix math, or a JIT library running routines But still, you can&amp;rsquo;t really call this a langauge.</description>

      <description>Chapter 22 - Custom Languages # Some people like playing around with new programming languages, or concepts in Programming Language Theory (PLT). In order to do this outside of pure mathematics, anyone who does will have to learn how to write a compiler for their new language.&#xA;Unfortunately, compilers are some of the most complex pieces of software out there, along with operating system kernels. Especially when talking about a common compiler for well-established language, there is no way a single guide on the internet can teach you how to write one.</description>

It is this meaning that is being captured, while the exact formatting or other details of the text itself are stripped away.&#xA;In our calculator, lexing (as it is called for short) is just one operation: line.</description>

      <description>Syntax analysis # Our syntax analysis phase, or &amp;ldquo;parsing&amp;rdquo;, is basically a no-op in the current version. This is possible because, thanks to our stack having a &amp;ldquo;guard zero&amp;rdquo; at the bottom, there is really no such thing as a program with only valid tokens that is invalid syntax.&#xA;This makes it a very rare language indeed.&#xA;Since we are doing math in a specific order of operations, it would be easy to make this into a tree.</description>

Whenever an operator occurs, it pops values off the stack at that point, performs the operation, and pushes the answer back on.&#xA;All operations are binary, so they take two operands from the stack and replace it with one result.</description>

      <description>10.11 - &amp;ldquo;Real&amp;rdquo; Programs # So, you now mostly know all the fundamental building blocks used to write basically everything out there.&#xA;But&amp;hellip; not really?&#xA;The thing is, almost any program of moderate complexity is going to rely on libraries to provide extra, (hopefully) well tested, performant, hard to write functionality. Plus, most programs don&amp;rsquo;t exist in a vacuum: you may need to hook into a database, send packets over the internet, check for malicious user input, write to files, encrypt data, use an API to interact with a game engine, or even write in a different language and call one language&amp;rsquo;s code from another.</description>

      <description>Chapter 12 - Life Of Code # Building # The C Build Process # I&amp;rsquo;m going to jump right in here, so things are going to be a bit brutal to understand for a bit. I&amp;rsquo;ll break things down, but I need to give the high-level view first! As we saw way back Hardware→CPU , your computer doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand instructions like printf(), so ultimately the code you write has to get turned into something your computer understands.</description>

Well, there&amp;rsquo;s only really a few options for learning low level programming that make sense to start with. C, C++, Rust are the &amp;lsquo;big three&amp;rsquo; that come to mind. C is what is most popular&amp;hellip;because it&amp;rsquo;s old and everything already uses it.</description>

      <description>Chapter 17 - Optimization # If you&amp;rsquo;re here, you&amp;rsquo;re probably able to at least write some code. Is it perfect code? Probably not - but what code is.&#xA;Good code should be:&#xA;Malleable - You should be able to change it if requirements change. Simple - It should be easy to read Portable - It should be able to run almost everywhere Performant - It should go fast Unfortunately, those things are a bit at odds with each other.</description>

      <description>31 - Control Systems # What are control systems? Well, the easiest way to answer that is to list the things control systems typically do:&#xA;What Can Control Systems do? # Amplify an input: # ex: Pluck a tiny string on a guitar, get an earth shaking output from the speaker Reduce the complexity of user input or change its location # ex: Floor button on an elevator- you don&amp;rsquo;t need to input a height off the ground for what floor you want to be on, nor do you need to enter values to compensate for how quickly it should get to its max speed or how fast it should slow down.</description>

Delay is just echos, reverb adds space, etc. Distortions sound simple enough, they just make it more aggressive - the problem is, they sometimes don&amp;rsquo;t. We have to think like an audio engineer here.&#xA;First, they sound massively different depending on the volume and frequency content of the input.</description>

      <description>Filters (LP, HP, BP, Notch) # See the signal processing chapters. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do real time DSP and if you want to modulate the cutoff, you&amp;rsquo;re probably stuck with an IIR. FWIW, the delay of an FIR means the linear phase is often worse than not anyway. If licensing isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably want to start with at least https://www.musicdsp.org/en/latest/Filters/index.html or really any DSP library. Implementing a well performing filter isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard.</description>

      <description>Time Based Effects # Delay # There are a million ways to make a delay that&amp;rsquo;s weird. Most basic? Make a ring buffer and add the signals, probably with a dry/wet mix. Less basic? IDK, add in multiple taps on the ring buffer? Use random samples in the buffer? Change the sample rate of the buffer? Reverse the buffer occasionally? Go nuts. Delay is basically echo.

      <description>Trivial Effects # Tremolo # This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically. This can be done at different speeds (really fast for a &amp;lsquo;deep&amp;rsquo; effect or slow for something pad-like) and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect.</description>

      <description>Continuing our Adventure # Picking up where we left off,&#xA;This lil&amp;rsquo; synth works, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us much control, and unlike a real instrument, after we let go of the key it just immediately stops. Similarly, most real instruments have a either a bit of a pluck at the start or a more gentle fade in.&#xA;This leads us to the idea of envelopes. In music, you&amp;rsquo;ll often want to draw a shape that evelopes a signal.</description>

      <description>Electro-Mechanical Instruments # I have a particular love of instruments that sit in that acoustic sweet spot where i feels as though there&amp;rsquo;s a physical resonating body merged with a synthesizer, where you can hear key clicks and a physical body but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t respond like we&amp;rsquo;re used to yet it&amp;rsquo;s not so avant-garde as not not be useful or just a gimmick.&#xA;Think a hurdy gurdy, but with an inbuilt tube amp and the drones are actually tube based oscillators.</description>

      <description>Percussion # Theory # Before I even dive into Percussion, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to point out how generic the term is. Just looking at the Wikipedia page for drum kit, you&amp;rsquo;ll see this: Drum Kit page on Wikipedia and clearly that&amp;rsquo;s still not an exhaustive list. Just off the top of my head I can see it lacks the Cajon or Taiko as acoustic instruments, let alone anything more specific than electronic drum, which can make for a class all its own.</description>

      <description>Strings # Guitars # Picture of my character by Alex the Nerd Bird Acoustic, Electric, Acoustic-Electric? # Hollow Body, Solid Body? # Pickups? # Frets? # Some guitars used &amp;ldquo;fanned&amp;rdquo; or multi-scale frets. This is most common on extended range (7+ string) guitars. The intent is that the scale length can be longer for the thick string and shorter for the thin so that the tension on all of them is reasonable (it avoids the low string being floppy).</description>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t told you anything that&amp;rsquo;s wrong, but I have been omitting something.&#xA;The software we&amp;rsquo;re using, VCV Rack, is very weird. It lacks many features that most people expect in a DAW - Digital Audio Workstation. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk significantly more about DAWs in a coming page, but I need to bring them up now because there&amp;rsquo;s some things that VCV absolutely does not do well that will make creating full songs that sound like music you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to unnecessarily difficult.</description>

Want to tell a hardware synth to play a sequence you arranged on your computer? MIDI. Want to play notes into your computer using a keyboard? MIDI. Want to sequence drums, with varying &amp;lsquo;velocity&amp;rsquo; on each hit? MIDI.&#xA;Sounds Great?&#xA;For the most part, yeah. Everything works together and you can make all your hardware speak the same language.</description>

      <description>Psychoacoustics and Cultural Associations # When we hear music, we don&amp;rsquo;t hear individual sine waves and sum them up. We don&amp;rsquo;t hear instruments devoid of context, either- a ukulele carries a different cultural meaning than a mandolin. We also don&amp;rsquo;t just hear what comes out the speakers as plainly as basic frequencies. Our ears process what we here. Our ears take in the reverb of the room, ignore sounds before and after drum hits, find speech in sounds that weren&amp;rsquo;t meant to.</description>

      <description>Sequencing &amp;amp; Midi # MIDI In Detail covers the technical bits of MIDI in much more detail, but you&#39;ll still probably want to read this first if you don&#39;t know what MIDI even is. Sequencing # The definition of a sequence is pretty obvious, but don&amp;rsquo;t be misled by the name- a &amp;ldquo;sequence&amp;rdquo; is not always just a list of notes to be played one after the other. Sometimes there&amp;rsquo;s overlap, gaps (rests), bends from one note to another (legato) and almost always information about how hard a note is pressed and how long it should be held for are saved.</description>

      <description>I will dispense this advice now # Over the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve joined a few new communities online, made a few new friends in meat space, and had a repeated conversation with my SO all about the same thing: &amp;ldquo;How can I be more like you?&amp;rdquo; (or, in one case &amp;ldquo;How can I be you&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip; yikes.) This is a really weird question to get. It is simultaneously asking for life advice, placing me on a pedestal as some sort of ideal, and sort of diminishes both my personal quirks and personality and the beauty in everyone&amp;rsquo;s uniqueness.</description>

      <description>Rhapsodaic # Rhapsodaic is a personal philosophical conlang where the morphemes are few, the analogies are many, and the pronouns are sometimes also adverbs.&#xA;It’s a language that prioritizes conceptual content over material content; all its root words refer to emotions, and anything else can only be described in relation to those emotions. It’s a tool I’ve made and used to process hard feelings, find novel ways of conveying hard-to-phrase experiences, gain new perspectives on things I’ve taken for granted, and connect with others over the radically different ways we see ourselves and the world(s) we occupy.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4: What points contradict? # Having Low Level Access and High Level Usability. # Yeah, this is always a problem. It&amp;rsquo;s always been the dream to be able to describe in &amp;rsquo;natural language&amp;rsquo; what you want and to have the computer parse what you want, inferring intent, and do whatever you want for you, but naturally, this will never be totally possible. This point is only conflicting in the sense that it can be overwhelming- if a user has access to work in something as high as natural language and can manipulate those instructions all the way down at the assembly level, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of open space.</description>

In general, we&amp;rsquo;ve mostly sucked at this, and while some things are getting better (monitor resolution) some things have gotten significantly worse (keyboards).</description>

      <description>Chapter 5: What Might Radically Change Things? # Breaking Away from Silicon, Binary, and Traditional Architectures # Probably the biggest change in computers that we could see would be rethinking the entire idea of how a computer works. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean changing the way users interact with a system, but by having new, radically different hardware designs developers may be inspired to make things that are currently impractical.</description>

      <description>Chapter 3: What&amp;rsquo;s Else Is Needed? # Script all the things! But Not Like That™ # Computers are, generally, really good at repetitive tasks. People are, generally, really bad at telling computers what they want.&#xA;This means that developers (which, I assume, is a large portion of those still reading this) need to make systems that let users automate tasks in a more user-friendly way than they would do it.</description>

      <description>Wrapping up # In all honesty, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what everything I just wrote is about. Mostly it&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of ranting, but hopefully it has been interesting. To round things off with a bit of a closing note though, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually foresee many of the things I mentioned becoming common place or many even being possible, if not simply because they&amp;rsquo;re requiring so many people to agree on standards, but there is one glimmer of hope, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of proof of uniformity.</description>

Seeing all the amazing things, proof that we can do better. Experiments that didn&amp;rsquo;t just succeed but have actually persisted to make the lives of those that use them better is both incredibly inspiring and immensely frustrating.&#xA;We have no excuses anymore. None of these are novel or difficult problems, not even the tragedy of the commons.</description>

Google&amp;rsquo;s search makes the entire top of the page ads, tracks you, and is just generally a bit invasive, but, you still probably use it instead of DuckDuckGo because the results often get you to what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for faster.&#xA;To some extent things have gotten better as it is gotten easier to search directly from the search bar, with more browsers supporting setting the search engine by a prefix in the url bar, so if, for example, I want to search Wikipedia and directly go to an article, I can just put a &amp;lsquo;w&amp;rsquo; before what I search:</description>

      <description>Freedom of Speech # xkcd №1357 The freedom of speech is weird, because it&amp;rsquo;s one that most of us recognize is that it should have limits because speech is powerful. The problem comes in what those limits are, which is why there are so many topics under debate:&#xA;Government Secrets Whistleblowing Hate Speech Political/Religious Opinion Copyright Parody Public Health Advertising of Sugar/Drugs Public Safety Creating Panic Encryption Self Incrimination Flag Burning National Pride Gag Orders National Security Porn/Cursing Public Decency (and the FCC) Advertising Spam Satire Defamation There&amp;rsquo;s also a question of where things go too far- at what point is speech a legitimate threat, and where is the line for actions that constitute harassment vs just being an asshole?</description>

      <description>Last year, 2023, I started the year with a lot of goals. Some of them I accomplished, others not so much. One, from the start, was to motivate my creative mind a bit more. To that end, I made a board with some of my favorite ideas and creative guidance I could. A mix of motivation, advice, ideas, and inspiration. This is that board, with some modifications, digitized.&#xA;While the contents of this board come from a variety of sources, the biggest two influences were the Catastrotivity series on YouTube and Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction.</description>

Given the music, DSP, and signals page I really care about sine waves and FFTs. It seems the best looking, lowest CPU sine I can get is using WEBGL (as immediately below) but writing the code for it is quite cumbersome. For math itself, https://github.com/airladon/figureone/ seems to be the best bet, and should dramatically help with the math chapters.</description>

      <description>OPINION Before anything else, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to point out this is opinionated guides.&#xA;Philosophy involves looking at the world around us and asking ourselves &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo;, then making arguments for how things should be different and what moral frameworks work best to come to conclusions that optimize for something like happiness or &amp;lsquo;goodness&amp;rsquo; in the world. Given that both morals and &amp;lsquo;goodness&amp;rsquo; are not absolutes, the best way for me to write this guide and actually be of service to you as a reader is to provide my opinion and talk about why I believe what believe both from a researched &amp;lsquo;here are the facts&amp;rsquo; sense and from a &amp;lsquo;here is the moral framework that, with these facts, brought me to this conclusion&amp;rsquo; sense.</description>

These might be mathy, like squares, or organic, like an eye&#xA;Form - Primarily applicable to 3D (or art interpreted as 3D) - Think of this as the shape you&amp;rsquo;d see if you could move around the object in real life</description>

On the other hand, you also likely encounter politicians people using these fallacies on a regular basis as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to call them out on it.</description>

      <description>Instruments # If you&amp;rsquo;re going to be playing an instrument though a computer - and I mean either an instrument which makes its own noise like a guitar or a controller like a MIDI keyboard - you&amp;rsquo;ll want to adjust your audio buffer size as best you can. See Optimizing The Latency Of Your PC Audio Interface from Sound on Sound for more info about this, but generally just set your buffer size as low as you can until it starts to sound like it&amp;rsquo;s horribly broken.</description>

      <description>Music Hardware # While you could make all of your music with just a computer, you’ll probably want some tools that make your life as a musician easier and let you explore ideas faster. Like I said back in the Audio Effects Chapter , in my experience, making music depends on a really quick brain to input device feedback loop. Being able to turn a physical knob and mash physical keys will often lead to better results if only because you’re able to try things both faster and by physically interacting with something that you may not have thought of otherwise.</description>

We need more people to really consider how ethics, politics, and copyright shape the world around us with technology and art as we design it and proceed with it.

Sample is a pretty broad term though, so usually some more terms are applied to help categorize them. Still, for the generic term what is usually meant is a small audio file that contains one sound, like one drum hit or one piano key press.</description>

      <description>First, this: # Don&amp;rsquo;t undervalue just sitting down and listening to music, trying to figure out what parts you enjoy and thinking about how it compares to what you&amp;rsquo;ve made, what you think you should change to sound better. Along with that, it helps to look at breakdowns of music done on YouTube. I particularly recommend all of the videos from 12tone&amp;rsquo;s channel.&#xA;Theory # I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest.</description>

      <description>An Interview With Wolfgun # 2/17/2023&#xA;Play Wolfgun is a space obsessed master of synthesizers with 50 albums out on Bandcamp. He primarily makes his music in Renoise, a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) which combines an old-school tracker workflow - think the equivalent of combining spreadsheets and music software with the sequence of notes and effects entered vertically, like the example on the left - with modern production capabilities.</description>
