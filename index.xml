      <description>You are on a page that is a heavy work in progress. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily stand by anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written here and this page should effectively be considered not yet published. I have decided to put it up while it is in development to encourage contributions What do you see when you sit down to work? My guess is a desk pressed against a wall, maybe a few shelves, one, maybe two monitors in front of you, and a keyboard and mouse dominating the work area of your desk.</description>

      <description>An Interview With Soatok Dreamseeker #  12/3/2020
Thank you for taking the time for this interview Soatok. Your blog at https://soatok.blog shows that you&amp;rsquo;re a furry crypto nerd, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to hear how you&amp;rsquo;d put it, so, to get started, can you describe yourself?
Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m asked, I usually say something to the effect of, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a security engineer with a dhole fursona that sometimes writes about cryptography on my furry blog.</description>

      <description>The year is 198x. #  I stare at my amber terminal. Hexadecimal fills my screen and my mind has become lost in the flow of 6502 assembly, as I hand optimize the code flow.
I&amp;rsquo;m interupted when I recieve a message from my friend, _Maverik, he&amp;rsquo;s excited about the ground breaking CGI in Tron.
 Nostalgia is a weird feeling. We can forget when things happened, and misttribute things to entirely different decades.</description>

      <description>As I walked to my car after class I could smell the ashes of a cigarette and hear the echos of a train scraping on its tracks. The cool foggy air held still beams of light. It looked like a scene from Blade runner, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like the Android&amp;rsquo;s of it&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, lusting after something to make me feel alive.
The drive home was mentally taxing. The fog so dense that cars ahead seemed to be balls of light floating in the distance and keeping sight of the lines to stay in my lane took a constant effort.</description>

      <description>An Interview With Loial Otter #  9/23/2018
Introduction:
I&amp;rsquo;m Matthew or LoialOtter, a crazy person up in western Canada who likes to make stuff. I work at Kron Technology as an engineer mainly in FPGA, electronics design and hardware design.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any credentials except a certificate in baking and pastry arts. I&amp;rsquo;m self-taught mostly due to not being ever able to afford going to school. I suggest others do when the have the opportunity but it isn&amp;rsquo;t absolutely required.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1 - The first goal #  Every journey needs a place to start, and while many may like to start slow I think a head first approach is best. So that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re gonna do. The very first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to do is install a new Operating System (OS) on your computer. This is a pretty involved process. It will require you to Repartition your drive, change settings in your BIOS or UEFI, and install a new Bootloader.</description>

      <description>Chapter 10 - Networking #  [TODO] Add follow along making a network stack
Basics #  Nodes
These are all the points in the network. There are terminal nodes and intermediate nodes.
Terminal nodes are things like your phone, laptop, desktop, and other user-facing devices, as well as servers, like would be used for hosting games or websites.
Intermediate nodes, are things that are internal to the network: Things like modems, hubs, switches, routers, etc.</description>

      <description>Chapter 11 - Math #   The next few chapters are, regrettably, necessary for developing your knack. Math, Physics, and Chemistry and fundamental to all engineering fields and while something about each of the three subjects finds a way to make the 16 year old highschooler in us release a long, exasperated groan. I think this is mostly due to each of these things being taught in a way that takes the fun and interesting parts out and replaces them with trying to learn skills that have largely been outdated by the advent of calculators, computers, and the internet.</description>

      <description>Chapter 13 - Chem #  This chapter is more or less on hold while I prioritize adding the content I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar with, if you&amp;rsquo;d like, feel free to submit a PR to flesh this section out. Unfortunately my chemistry education was pretty &amp;lsquo;meh&amp;rsquo;, and I never actually made it to Organic Chem. I have CrashCourse&amp;rsquo;s Chemistry and Organic Chemistry videos on YouTube on my &amp;lsquo;To Watch&amp;rsquo; list though. Obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they&amp;rsquo;re any good, but maybe they&amp;rsquo;d be a decent place to start.</description>

Show everything in a circuit sim, fix heading levels (this is a mess)
Possibly break up this chapter? Transistors, the opamp, etc alone may each justify their own chapters
That said, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get to in the mud of transistor physics. I really want to focus on how/when/why to use what, not how they work as the physics is both pretty hard to grasp and not super useful.</description>

  Prototype before polishing. Get it working before optimizing it. Separate policy from mechanism, separate interfaces from engines. Write simple modular parts connected by clean interfaces. Design programs to be connected to other programs. Write programs to write programs when you can. Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.

And honestly, that&amp;rsquo;s to by accident. While there are strictly professional security experts, those that work at corporations and banks, a large number do it for the lolz, for fun, and to bring a little fun back into computing.</description>

      <description>One of the nifty things about Linux is you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install extra software to check out the deeper parts of your hardware. While on windows you might need a tool like CPU-Z to look at information about the CPU on Linux you can do it out of the box. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started on that then!
The CPU #  These are CPUS or Central Processing Units. They&amp;rsquo;re the beating heart of your computer, doing the day-to-day number crunching.</description>

question of the day:
Analog TV is shut down in the US, right? so all the over-the-air TV is digital. And existing analog OTA frequencies are getting repurposed to other uses... so what am I seeing on UHF channel 60? it&amp;#39;s got way more structure than the noise everywhere else.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6 - Let&amp;rsquo;s work on how we work #  The Terminal #  In the world of programming, embedded development, and electrical debugging you will inevitably need to understand how to use a terminal/command line at some point. While the text only interface can look intimidating, it has some clear advantages. Namely it&amp;rsquo;s significantly faster to use the cli or &amp;lsquo;command line interface&amp;rsquo; version of many tools. Because of the nature of this guide you will be using the terminal frequently, so for convince sake information on using it effectively has been moved to Appendix A, though I highly recommend you read though it now.</description>

And I get it. But it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad for two reasons:
 The math isn&amp;rsquo;t like what you&amp;rsquo;re used to. The math is actually doing something. You&amp;rsquo;re not just getting a number to solve a problem, you&amp;rsquo;re making a tool that can solve many problems or watching the math cause something to happen on screen.</description>

      <description>Chapter 7½ - Consequences #  Programming is awesome. If you get into creative coding you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use it to make art. You&amp;rsquo;ll likely use it to automate tasks you find boring. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you might use it to make your own website or start to make products you intend to sell. That&amp;rsquo;s great. But there are a few things you need to consider as what you make becomes more professional.</description>

Why C? #  This chapter of OpGuides will be mostly C, but, why? Well, there&amp;rsquo;s only really a few options for learning low level programming that make sense to start with. C, C++, Rust are the &amp;lsquo;big three&amp;rsquo; that come to mind for me. C is awesome. It&amp;rsquo;s spec is small, it&amp;rsquo;s been kept minimal, and it&amp;rsquo;s got a ton of tools to help you learn.</description>

      <description>Hey there, #  My name is Vega. I know there are plenty of tutorials and ways to learn online be it on YouTube, SkillShare, or online classes provided for free by various universities. The difference here is there is no content you&amp;rsquo;ll never use, no babysitting, and lots of bias as a result of personal experience. My views of things like what programming languages are bad or what hardware you should buy to learn on will be expressed directly and bluntly.</description>

      <description>Ⅰ - Community #  The only way to be successful in this journey is to make friends along the way. Some of this gets really, really difficult. You will get stuck. Having friends to help makes it possible. Find group chats on telegram, join IRC channels, get on some forums, and ask questions on Reddit. Working with people is a lot more fun and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn so much more.</description>

      <description>Ⅱ - Learn how to learn #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep this short and sweet: Nobody learns (effectively) by being shown what to do. You can watch hundreds of hours of people playing guitar, even explaining how they do it, but you wont be able to randomly pick one up and play if you never have before. Furthermore, as much as you can learn from direct reading and instruction, it has it&amp;rsquo;s place and limits.</description>

      <description>Other cool things that I want to promote but don&amp;rsquo;t fit elsewhere so I&amp;rsquo;m making this list here: #    Brimestone Valley Mall
 The year is 1999. Lurking somewhere between Hot Topic and the food court, five misfit demons from Hell kill time inciting sin in a suburban shopping mall. When the lead singer of their band goes mysteriously missing, the demons only have two weeks to find him before they play the biggest gig of the millennium - or face the wrath of Satan herself.</description>

      <description>Philosophical Arguments #  [TODO]how to construct a phil argument
Not simply accepting &amp;ldquo;Because that&amp;rsquo;s how it is&amp;rdquo; #  I&amp;rsquo;m writing this at @292.78 on Day 132 of 12,020. I&amp;rsquo;m typing on a Dvorak, split, ortholinear keyboard in a markdown document using Arch Linux instead of M$ Word on Windows, and if you&amp;rsquo;d like you could view this document using DAT or IPFS or LBRY. I find music off the 12 tone scale interesting, and while I know 432 vs 440hz, isn&amp;rsquo;t going to open my 3rd eye, listening to microtonal or music made with just intonation is still something interesting to me.</description>

      <description>OPINION          Before anything else, I think it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to point out this is opinionated guides. Philosophy involves looking at the world around us and asking ourselves &amp;lsquo;why&amp;rsquo;, then making arguments for how things should be different and what moral frameworks work best to come to conclusions that optimize for something like happiness or &amp;lsquo;goodness&amp;rsquo; in the world. Given that both morals and &amp;lsquo;goodness&amp;rsquo; are not absolutes, the best way for me to write this guide and actually be of service to you as a reader is to provide my opinion and talk about why I believe what believe both from a researched &amp;lsquo;here are the facts&amp;rsquo; sense and from a &amp;lsquo;here is the moral framework that, with these facts, brought me to this conclusion&amp;rsquo; sense.</description>

      <description>Audio Effects #  Tremolo #  This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically, usually pretty fast and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect. In VCV this can be done as simply as hooking up an LFO to a VCA&amp;rsquo;s CV input like we did here, but turning up the frequency of the LFO-2 module (note, that here there is no bias so the volume does actually cut out):    Vibrato #  Vibrato as an effect requires pitch shifting, which I suppose actually makes it akin to FM synthesis as in Chapter 2, regardless, it&amp;rsquo;s as simple as applying a, typically subtle, pitch &amp;lsquo;wobble&amp;rsquo; into the sound.</description>

      <description>Logical Fallacies (and a bit more) #  If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on the internet for more than about a quarter of a second, you&amp;rsquo;ve likely been accused of a whole host of logical fallacies. Unfortunately, most people really don&amp;rsquo;t understand what they&amp;rsquo;re saying and often use a lot of these incorrectly. On the other hand, you also likely encounter politicians people using these fallacies on a regular basis as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to call them out on it.</description>

Note, there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty limited number of MPE capable instruments, thankfully there&amp;rsquo;s stil a decent price range between them. This list is not exhaustive, but I think gives a good sampling:

      <description>Old Version, needs migrated: #  Because you&amp;rsquo;re now somebody in the know about topics relating to technology and have a deeper understanding about issues that may effect the public, such as The FBI V Apple encryption case, Issues regrading internet speed and infrastructure, or The Government/NSA spying on people. There are plenty of issues that weather you like it or not you&amp;rsquo;re one of the few with enough information to truly understand and inform your peers.</description>

      <description>The fight for the Internet is never ending. At the time of writing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried to tie anti §230 legislation to the $2000 stimulus checks, and my own Congress Critter, Ben Sasse (R,Nebraska), along with Jeff Merkley (D,Oregon) are trying to push though SISEA - the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act, which on paper sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s doing good to stop the possibility of revenge porn. Unfortunately, they want to do this by requiring that all people in porn expressly give the site written consent with identity verification.</description>

      <description>Thank you #  If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far I just want to say thank you. We need more people to really consider how ethics, politics, and copyright shape the world around us with technology and art as we design it and proceed with it. DeepFakes, Automated driving, and even more mass online censorship are issues we&amp;rsquo;re only going to face more with time and it&amp;rsquo;s people like you who are going to help make sure we take the best path we can.</description>

      <description>Religion #  [TODO] The engineering community is strangely divided, the &amp;lsquo;old guard&amp;rsquo; is actually relatively conservative and professional, but as time has moved forward it&amp;rsquo;s quite the opposite. Unsurprisingly, this correlates with religion as well. The main way this plays into politics is a general hard stance for the separation of church and state. This is in part due to a past of religiously motivated legislation negatively impacting copyright law, but also just generally an understood ideal that is beneficial to democracy.</description>

      <description>Methods of making noise #  Samples #   a snippet of a .wav file open in audacity
 A sample is exactly as the name implies- a &amp;lsquo;sample&amp;rsquo; of audio. Sample is a pretty broad term though, so usually some more terms are applied to help categorize them. The easiest to explain is what is usually meant by sample: a small audio file that contains one sound, like one drum hit or one piano key press.</description>

      <description>First, this: #   Theory #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest. I can&amp;rsquo;t read music and I don&amp;rsquo;t know scales. Why, then, would I in any way think I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to write anything about music? Well, let me stop you right there, I&amp;rsquo;m not. I make music for fun. However, I like to think that people enjoy my music and I enjoy listening to it myself as I make it, and though my experience I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a little here and there to make sure things don&amp;rsquo;t sound awful.</description>
