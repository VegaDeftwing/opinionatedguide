      <description>Anti Consumer #  As I walked to my car after class I could smell the ashes of a cigarette and hear the echos of a train scraping on its tracks. The cool foggy air held still beams of light. It looked like a scene from Blade runner, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but feel like the Android&amp;rsquo;s of it&amp;rsquo;s inspiration, lusting after something to make me feel alive.
The drive home was mentally taxing.</description>

      <description>Chapter 1 - The first goal #  Every journey needs a place to start, and while many may like to start slow I think a head first approach is best. So that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re gonna do. The very first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to do is install a new operating system (OS) on your computer.
Operating System: According to Wikipedia, &amp;ldquo;An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.</description>

      <description>Chapter 11 - Math #   The next few chapters are, regrettably, necessary for developing your knack. Math, Physics, and Chemistry and fundamental to all engineering fields and while something about each of the three subjects finds a way to make the 16 year old highschooler in us release a long, exasperated groan. I think this is mostly due to each of these things being taught in a way that takes the fun and interesting parts out and replaces them with trying to learn skills that have largely been outdated by the advent of calculators, computers, and the internet.</description>

Show everything in a circuit sim, fix heading levels (this is a mess)
Possibly break up this chapter? Transistors, the opamp, etc alone may each justify their own chapters
That said, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get to in the mud of transistor physics. I really want to focus on how/when/why to use what, not how they work as the physics is both pretty hard to grasp and not super useful.</description>

Linux is actually just the name of the underlying &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; of the system, known as the kernel, as such, there are literally thousands of Linux variations.</description>

      <description>Chapter 23 - Exploitation #   XKCD: https://xkcd.com/2166/
 Often when we think about Exploitation, better known as hacking, we conjure images of a more-punk-than-cyber cyberpunk person clicking away wildly on a keyboard as code flies by, like the 1995 movie, Hackers, and to some extent this isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong, as one look around the floor at DefCon, will show you. And honestly, that&amp;rsquo;s to by accident. While there are strictly professional security experts, those that work at corporations and banks, a large number do it for the lolz, for fun, and to bring a little fun back into computing.</description>

question of the day:
Analog TV is shut down in the US, right? so all the over-the-air TV is digital. And existing analog OTA frequencies are getting repurposed to other uses... so what am I seeing on UHF channel 60? it&amp;#39;s got way more structure than the noise everywhere else.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6 - Let&amp;rsquo;s work on how we work #  The Terminal #  In the world of programming, embedded development, and electrical debugging you will inevitably need to understand how to use a terminal/command line at some point. While the text only interface can look intimidating, it has some clear advantages, namely it&amp;rsquo;s significantly faster to use the cli or &amp;lsquo;command line interface&amp;rsquo; version of many tools. Because of the nature of this book you will be using the terminal frequently, so for convince sake information on using it effectively has been moved to Appendix A, though I highly recommend you read though it now.</description>

      <description>Chapter 7 - Let&amp;rsquo;s write some Code #  From https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#development:
  Prototype before polishing. Get it working before optimizing it. Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines. Write simple modular parts connected by clean interfaces. Design programs to be connected to other programs. Write programs to write programs when you can. Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think. In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.</description>

Yes, they&amp;rsquo;re different, but before I talk about the shell it&amp;rsquo;s easier to talk about the Terminal.
The Terminal is a piece of hardware, or, rather was a piece of hardware.</description>

      <description>Hey there, #  My name is Vega. I know there are plenty of tutorials and ways to learn online be it on YouTube, SkillShare, or online classes provided for free by various universities. The difference here is there is no content you&amp;rsquo;ll never use, no babysitting, and lots of bias as a result of personal experience. My views of things like what programming languages are bad or what hardware you should buy to learn on will be expressed directly and bluntly.</description>

Having friends to help makes it possible. Find group chats on telegram, join IRC channels, get on some forums, and ask questions on Reddit. Working with people is a lot more fun and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn so much more.</description>

      <description>Ⅱ - Learn how to learn #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep this short and sweet: Nobody learns (effectively) by being shown what to do. You can watch hundreds of hours of people playing guitar, even explaining how they do it, but you wont be able to randomly pick one up and play if you never have before. Furthermore, as much as you can learn from direct reading and instruction, it has it&amp;rsquo;s place and limits.</description>

 The year is 1999. Lurking somewhere between Hot Topic and the food court, five misfit demons from Hell kill time inciting sin in a suburban shopping mall.

Here&amp;rsquo;s the head of the Wikipedia entry on Philosophy:
 Philosophy (from Greek: φιλοσοφία, philosophia, &amp;lsquo;love of wisdom&amp;rsquo;)[1][2][3] is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language

      <description>Letting Society Advance Though Art and Innovation #  I think to further address any issues we first need to look into how these issues have come to exist. In general, as a society advances new issues will arise. Computers and the Internet have shown us just how incredibly things can progress and how amazing un-hindered, open information flow can change the world. The Internet has served as an educational tool of unparalleled utility to my generation and has allowed me to learn things that I otherwise would have never had access to.</description>

Okay, yes, the current political climate, the idea of Software As a Service, and about a thousand other things given that I&amp;rsquo;ve literally got the word opinionated in this sites name&amp;hellip;
But today, today I want to rant about digital data storage- formats, backups, and the like.
 Archival is a pain in the ass No good backup software Phone&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;PC is the fucking worst  MTP needs to die a very painful death   All the best formats are a pain in the ass  format shifting sucks, opening them sucks, patents suck https://bellard.</description>

      <description>Hey there.
My name is Vega. I know there are plenty of tutorials and ways to learn online be it on YouTube, SkillShare, or online classes provided for free by various universities. The difference here is there is no bullshit, no babysitting, and lots of bias as a result of personal experience. My views of things like what cretive software is bad (Adobe) or what equipment you should buy to learn with will be expressed directly and bluntly.</description>

      <description>Audio Effects #  Tremolo #  This is probably the easiest to understand audio effect. Put simply, fade the volume in and out automatically, usually pretty fast and with a bias so that the volume never completely cuts. It can also refer to a playing style where the same note is struck rapidly, leading to a similar effect. In VCV this can be done as simply as hooking up an LFO to a VCA&amp;rsquo;s CV input like we did here, but turning up the frequency of the LFO-2 module (note, that here there is no bias so the volume does actually cut out):</description>

Unfortunately, most people really don&amp;rsquo;t understand what they&amp;rsquo;re saying and often use a lot of these incorrectly. On the other hand, you also likely encounter politicians people using these fallicies on a regular basis as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to call them out on it.</description>

I don&amp;rsquo;t have any credentials except a certificate in baking and pastry arts. I&amp;rsquo;m self-taught mostly due to not being ever able to afford going to school. I suggest others do when the have the opportunity but it isn&amp;rsquo;t absolutely required.</description>

In a bit I&amp;rsquo;ll be going though how to use VCV Rack, a free (with paid addons, but those aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary) program for making music. But as we go though each bit is going to look so -basic- that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see the bigger picture.</description>

      <description>Religion #  The engineering community is strangely divided, the &amp;lsquo;old guard&amp;rsquo; is actually relatively conservative and professional, but as time has moved forward it&amp;rsquo;s quite the opposite. Unsurprisingly, this correlates with religion as well. The main way this plays into politics is a general hard stance for the separation of church and state. This is in part due to a past of religiously motivated legislation negatively impacting copyright law, but also just generally an understood ideal that is beneficial to democracy.</description>

      <description>Sex #  In an ideal world human kind would be driven forward by more than the initiate desire to reproduce and bone. Then again, if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have evolved to this point where we&amp;rsquo;re capable of reflecting on that irony, in the first place.

      <description>Methods of making noise #  Samples #   a snippet of a .wav file open in audacity
 A sample is exactly as the name implies- a &amp;lsquo;sample&amp;rsquo; of audio. Sample is a pretty broad term though, so usually some more terms are applied to help categorize them. The easiest to explain is what is usually meant by sample: a small audio file that contains one sound, like one drum hit or one piano key press.</description>

      <description>First, this: #   Theory #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest. I can&amp;rsquo;t read music and I don&amp;rsquo;t know scales. Why, then, would I in any way think I&amp;rsquo;m qualified to write anything about music? Well, let me stop you right there, I&amp;rsquo;m not. I make music for fun. However, I like to think that people enjoy my music and I enjoy listening to it myself as I make it, and though my experience I&amp;rsquo;ve picked up a little here and there to make sure things don&amp;rsquo;t sound awful.</description>

      <description>The year is 198x. #  I stare at my amber terminal. Hexadecimal fills my screen and my mind has become lost in the flow of 6502 assembly, as I hand optimize the code flow.
I&amp;rsquo;m interupted when I recieve a message from my friend, _Maverik, he&amp;rsquo;s excited about the ground breaking CGI in Tron.
 Nostalgia is a weird feeling. We can forget when things happened, and misttribute things to entirely different decades.</description>
