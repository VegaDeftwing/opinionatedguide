I'm going to keep this short and sweet: Nobody learns (effectively) by being shown what to do. You can watch hundreds of hours of people playing guitar, even explaining how they do it, but you wont be able to randomly pick one up and play if you never have before. Furthermore, as much as you can learn from direct reading and instruction, it has it's place and limits. This guide, book, whatever you want to call it, was never meant to be followed like instructions. You should go out on your own and poke around, get lost in the weeds as you go. If you find a topic dull, don't read it as in depth. I don't want you wasting your time. Break things. Make mistakes. By the end of this you should know what a burning resistor smells like, what it's like to try to recover from a Linux system that just won't boot, and how it feels when a bug has been eluding you for hours and your code still doesn't work. The only way that happens (unless I made a mistake which is also probable) is if you try ideas when you get them and do more than what's in this book.

This struggle is part of learning and proof that you're doing well. These experiences should teach you things in their own right. The smell of burning electronics may help you diagnose a future circuit, the lesson to not fall into a pit of technical debt may help when a bug has engulfed your code, and the late night of terminal only based work as you try to get your computer working again will teach you more than this book ever can.

To quote someone much smarted than myself:

but note, you should keep in mind the standard warning that comes when first using `sudo` if you plan to use Cunningham's law to your advantage:
