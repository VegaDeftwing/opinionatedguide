      <description>Chapter 1 - The first goal #  Every journey needs a place to start, and while many may like to start slow I think a head first approach is best. So that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what we&amp;rsquo;re gonna do. The very first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to do is install a new Operating System (OS) on your computer. This is a pretty involved process. It will require you to Repartition your drive, change settings in your BIOS or UEFI, and install a new Bootloader.</description>

      <description>Chapter 10 - Networking #  [TODO] Add follow along making a network stack
Basics #  Nodes
These are all the points in the network. There are terminal nodes and intermediate nodes.
Terminal nodes are things like your phone, laptop, desktop, and other user-facing devices, as well as servers, like would be used for hosting games or websites.
Intermediate nodes, are things that are internal to the network: Things like modems, hubs, switches, routers, etc.</description>

      <description>Chapter 11 - Math #   The next few chapters are, regrettably, necessary for developing your knack. Math, Physics, and Chemistry and fundamental to all engineering fields and while something about each of the three subjects finds a way to make the 16 year old highschooler in us release a long, exasperated groan. I think this is mostly due to each of these things being taught in a way that takes the fun and interesting parts out and replaces them with trying to learn skills that have largely been outdated by the advent of calculators, computers, and the internet.</description>

Show everything in a circuit sim, fix heading levels (this is a mess)
Possibly break up this chapter? Transistors, the opamp, etc alone may each justify their own chapters
That said, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get to in the mud of transistor physics. I really want to focus on how/when/why to use what, not how they work as the physics is both pretty hard to grasp and not super useful.</description>

 Note, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to directly compare pricing between these services because that&amp;rsquo;s both rather variable and because the cost is often in terms of resource usage, which can be calculated in so many different way that the only real way to compare is to actually run something.</description>

Linux is actually just the name of the underlying &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; of the system, known as the kernel, as such, there are literally thousands of Linux variations.</description>

CRUD #  Create, Read, Update, Delete
SQL #  !&amp;gt; This is Opinionated Guides, so let me be clear, I really, really hate SQL. I don&amp;rsquo;t like OOP in general, and SQL is sorta like object orientation taken further.

      <description>Chapter 23 - Exploitation #   XKCD: https://xkcd.com/2166/
 Often when we think about Exploitation, better known as hacking, we conjure images of a more-punk-than-cyber cyberpunk person clicking away wildly on a keyboard as code flies by, like the 1995 movie, Hackers, and to some extent this isn&amp;rsquo;t wrong, as one look around the floor at DefCon, will show you. And honestly, that&amp;rsquo;s to by accident. While there are strictly professional security experts, those that work at corporations and banks, a large number do it for the lolz, for fun, and to bring a little fun back into computing.</description>

question of the day:
Analog TV is shut down in the US, right? so all the over-the-air TV is digital. And existing analog OTA frequencies are getting repurposed to other uses... so what am I seeing on UHF channel 60? it&amp;#39;s got way more structure than the noise everywhere else.</description>

      <description>Chapter 4 - Back to the Root of Things #  We&amp;rsquo;ve been using file in /proc and /dev throughout this, but we never really looked to see what else is in there. Let&amp;rsquo;s do that.
go ahead and open up a terminal and run
╭─vega@lyrae ~ ╰─➤ cd /dev ╭─vega@lyrae /dev ╰─➤ ls [Very, Very Long Output here] Alright, I know what you&amp;rsquo;re thinking.
What. The. Actual. Fuck.

The Tools of the Trade #  Building, fixing, and analyzing circuitry requires the use of a few tools and appliences. While there are many more than those listed here, these are the most important ones and should be all you need for most even very advanced applications.
The Multimeter #   !&amp;gt; note, the above video uses U=IR instead of V=IR like &amp;lsquo;normal&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Chapter 6 - Let&amp;rsquo;s work on how we work #  The Terminal #  In the world of programming, embedded development, and electrical debugging you will inevitably need to understand how to use a terminal/command line at some point. While the text only interface can look intimidating, it has some clear advantages. Namely it&amp;rsquo;s significantly faster to use the cli or &amp;lsquo;command line interface&amp;rsquo; version of many tools. Because of the nature of this guide you will be using the terminal frequently, so for convince sake information on using it effectively has been moved to Appendix A, though I highly recommend you read though it now.</description>

      <description>Chapter 7½ - Consequences #  Programming is awesome. If you get into creative coding you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to use it to make art. You&amp;rsquo;ll likely use it to automate tasks you find boring. If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you might use it to make your own website or start to make products you intend to sell. That&amp;rsquo;s great. But there are a few things you need to consider as what you make becomes more professional.</description>

What The Shell? #  Okay, first question you probably have after I&amp;rsquo;ve been using them interchangebly &amp;lsquo;What is a Shell and is it different from a terminal?&amp;rsquo;
Yes, they&amp;rsquo;re different, but before I talk about the shell it&amp;rsquo;s easier to talk about the Terminal.
The Terminal is a piece of hardware, or, rather was a piece of hardware.</description>

      <description>Hey there, #  My name is Vega. I know there are plenty of tutorials and ways to learn online be it on YouTube, SkillShare, or online classes provided for free by various universities. The difference here is there is no content you&amp;rsquo;ll never use, no babysitting, and lots of bias as a result of personal experience. My views of things like what programming languages are bad or what hardware you should buy to learn on will be expressed directly and bluntly.</description>

      <description>Ⅰ - Community #  The only way to be successful in this journey is to make friends along the way. Some of this gets really, really difficult. You will get stuck. Having friends to help makes it possible. Find group chats on telegram, join IRC channels, get on some forums, and ask questions on Reddit. Working with people is a lot more fun and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn so much more.</description>

      <description>Ⅱ - Learn how to learn #  I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep this short and sweet: Nobody learns (effectively) by being shown what to do. You can watch hundreds of hours of people playing guitar, even explaining how they do it, but you wont be able to randomly pick one up and play if you never have before. Furthermore, as much as you can learn from direct reading and instruction, it has it&amp;rsquo;s place and limits.</description>
